0,60360,8,"Her life virtually began with her awakening at the hospital. A look of wonder and a faint smile were the only replies that questions as to the past elicited from her. Old and tried specialists in brain diseases and hypnotic states came from every part of the Union on bootless errands. It was decided that nothing could be done; rest, freedom from every care and time might eventually restore the poor, violated mind to its original strength. Thus it was that Dianthe became the dear adopted daughter of the medical profession. Strange to say, Molly Vance secured her desire, and wearing the name of Felice Adams, Dianthe was domiciled under the roof of palatial Vance hall, and the small annuity provided by the generous contributions of the physicians of the country was placed in the hands of Mr. Vance, Sr., to be expended for their protege.",authentic,hopkins,ofonebloodorthehiddenself,authentic,American,female,black,24.33333333333333,-0.956153392791748,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.6805555555555556,0.5763888888888888,2.263813559322034,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0416666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0972222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0277777777777777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2361111111111111,0.0694444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0763888888888889,0.0138888888888888,0.0416666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0763888888888889,0.0,0.0,0.0347222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0277777777777777,0.1527777777777778,0.125

Fierce faces, rough and dirty, with the inevitable pipe, or tobacco saliva marking the corners of the mouth, filled in the picture, while a running accompaniment of the strongest and vilest oaths ears ever heard suggested all the horrors of mob violence. The court proceeded with its farcical mockery of justice. Warren undertook to act as his own counsel, and drew up the following protest:  â€œI, the undersigned, a British subject, do hereby protest against every step taken thus far by the State of Missouri in this case; declaring that my rights as a British subject have been infamously violated and trampled upon.",authentic,hopkins,WINONA,authentic,American,female,black,37.0,-0.9838829040527344,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.7310344827586207,0.5793103448275863,2.5076422764227644,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0275862068965517,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0344827586206896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0137931034482758,0.1034482758620689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0344827586206896,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2068965517241379,0.0551724137931034,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0344827586206896,0.0206896551724137,0.0482758620689655,0.0275862068965517,0.0068965517241379,0.1034482758620689,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0206896551724137,0.1586206896551724,0.1517241379310344

On they rushed from north, south, east and west, eyes aflame, faces distorted, the brute latent in every human being coming out from his lair to blot out the man, the awful cries, waning, waxing.

The men beside him were strangers, and more unreal than the vast chamber. Dark-visaged, he noticed that they ranged in complexion from a creamy tint to purest ebony; the long hair which fell upon their shoulders, varied in texture from soft, waving curls to the crispness of the most pronounced African type. But the faces into which he gazed were perfect in the cut and outline of every feature; the forms hidden by soft white drapery, Grecian in effect, were athletic and beautifully moulded.

His arms were bound down against his sides, the wounded one causing him frightful torture. His shirt was open at the throat, showing the ivory firmness of his chest and the beating pulse in the white brawn.

The porch overlooked the blooming fields where a thousand acres stretched to the very edge of the muddy Missouri.

And what an expressive face, full of character! Long, jet-black hair and totally free, covered her shoulders like a silken mantle; a broad, square forehead, a warm bronze complexion; thick black eyebrows, great black eyes, now soft and languishing--eyes which could weep in sorrow or shoot forth lightning in their anger; a delicate nose with quivering nostrils, teeth of dazzling whiteness behind lips as red as a rose; in her smile of grace and sweetness lurked a sense of power.

20,20905,3,"General Belmont, the smaller of the two, was a man of good family, a lawyer by profession, and took an active part in state and local politics. Aristocratic by birth and instinct, and a former owner of slaves, his conception of the obligations and rights of his caste was nevertheless somewhat lower than that of the narrower but more sincere Carteret. In serious affairs Carteret desired the approval of his conscience, even if he had to trick that docile organ into acquiescence. This was not difficult to do in politics, for he believed in the divine right of white men and gentlemen, as his ancestors had believed in and died for the divine right of kings.

Two other couples completed the set; others were restrained by bashfulness or religious scruples, which did not yield until later in the evening. The perfumed air from the garden without and the cut roses within mingled incongruously with the alien odors of musk and hair oil, of which several young barbers in the company were especially redolent.

35,19685,3,"In November, 1894, a movement was begun in Rochester, under the leadership of J. W. Thompson, with a view to erect a monument in memory of the colored soldiers and sailors who had fallen during the Civil War. This project had the hearty support and assistance of Douglass; and upon his death the plan was changed, and a monument to Douglass himself decided upon. A contribution of one thousand dollars from the Haytian government and an appropriation of three thousand dollars from the State of New York assured the success of the plan. September 15, 1898, was the date set for the unveiling of the monument; but, owing to delay in the delivery of the statue, only a part of the contemplated exercises took place.",authentic,chesnutt,Frederick Douglass,authentic,American,male,black,31.25,0.976209282875061,0.0166666666666666,0.0,0.6,0.4833333333333333,2.3642990654205605,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0416666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0166666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0166666666666666,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0166666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0416666666666666,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.025,0.0583333333333333,0.0083333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0083333333333333,0.0083333333333333,0.1833333333333333,0.1916666666666666

She had on an evening gown, while her head was hidden in a bonnet. With her back to the street, she stood leveling the water from the hose at the various flower groups. While she was thus engaged, a man above the average in height, possessing a form that conveyed the impression of nobility and strength, was in the act of passing by.

The Duke, therefore firing a signal gun to the fleet to follow, stood by her to the dismay of the English, thus baulked of so rich a prey. In the strategy of getting the wounded ship back to her place in the formation came the second disaster; for the foremast of the flagship of Don Pedro de Valdes _Nuestra Senora del Rosario_ gave way at the hatches, falling on the mainsail boom.

43,60224,2,"With the national thought focused on politics, in that arena a man is more sorely tried, his powers put to more severe tests, his strong and his weak points more clearly developed than in any other sphere of activity. He who emerges from the galling fire of American politics unscathed, must be accorded a crown of unfading glory. To illustrate the ordeal through which one must pass, we cite the following comment:  ""In turning over the files of the American press, we read of Washington as an embezzler; of Jefferson as an atheist, an anarchist and a libertine; of Adams as a tyrant; and of Jackson as a bully, a border ruffian and an assassin. Van Buren was accused of stealing gold spoons from the 'White House.' The stock epithet applied to President Lincoln was the 'Illinois baboon.' President Johnson was habitually described as a 'drunken boor.'",authentic,griggs,Unfettered,authentic,American,male,black,24.5,0.9704138040542604,0.0277777777777777,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.5625,2.44099173553719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0486111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0347222222222222,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2291666666666666,0.0486111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.0277777777777777,0.0347222222222222,0.0138888888888888,0.0277777777777777,0.0694444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0208333333333333,0.1597222222222222,0.1527777777777778

48,20429,2,"The night was warm, and the drive homeward under the starlight, in the open carriage, had a soothing effect upon Rena's excited nerves. The calm restfulness of the night, the cool blue depths of the unclouded sky, the solemn croaking of the frogs in a distant swamp, were much more in harmony with her nature than the crowded brilliancy of the ball-room. She closed her eyes, and, leaning back in the carriage, thought of her mother, who she wished might have seen her daughter this night. A momentary pang of homesickness pierced her tender heart, and she furtively wiped away the tears that came into her eyes.

53,58866,2,"One night while the sailors slept in fancied security, some powerful engine of destruction demolished the vessel and ended the lives of some 266 American seamen. A board of inquiry was sent by the United States Government to the scene of the disaster, and, after a careful investigation of a most thorough character, decided that the explosion was not internal and accidental but external and by design. This finding made war between the United States and Spain practically inevitable. While the whole nation was in the throes of war excitement, a terrible tragedy occurred. President McKinley had appointed Mr. Felix A. Cook, a colored man of ability, culture and refinement as postmaster of Lake City, South Carolina. The white citizens of this place made no protest against the appointment and all was deemed satisfactory.",authentic,griggs,Imperium in Imperio,authentic,American,male,black,22.33333333333333,0.4758020341396332,0.0,0.0,0.6870229007633588,0.5954198473282443,2.393217391304348,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0381679389312977,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0534351145038167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.015267175572519,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0916030534351145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015267175572519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015267175572519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0687022900763358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015267175572519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015267175572519,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0305343511450381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015267175572519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519083969465648,0.0534351145038167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0916030534351145,0.0,0.0229007633587786,0.015267175572519,0.0,0.1297709923664122,0.0,0.0,0.0229007633587786,0.0,0.0076335877862595,0.0,0.0,0.1526717557251908,0.1755725190839694

55,59872,2,"So, I agree with 'Squire Mullen that it is a great help to superiors to keep alive in inferiors a well developed sense of their inferiority. It certainly helps to keep them in subjection. The Scythian whips, which had as an aid the feeling of inferiority, were more successful than arms would have been, carrying along with them the idea of equality. ""A profound thinker of our day sets forth this idea in these words:  ""'There are the respective mental traits produced by daily exercise of power and by daily submission to power. The ideas, and sentiments, and modes of behavior, perpetually repeated, generate on the one side an inherited fitness for command, and on the other side an inherited fitness for obedience; with the result that, in course of time, there arises on both sides the belief that the established relations of classes are the natural ones.'""",authentic,griggs,Unfettered,authentic,American,male,black,29.6,0.9982056021690368,0.0,0.0,0.6643835616438356,0.5547945205479452,2.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0753424657534246,0.0136986301369863,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0068493150684931,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0547945205479452,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1986301369863013,0.0821917808219178,0.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0136986301369863,0.0068493150684931,0.0205479452054794,0.0273972602739726,0.0273972602739726,0.1095890410958904,0.0,0.0,0.0342465753424657,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0136986301369863,0.184931506849315,0.136986301369863

The wave of enthusiasm which had swept the enfranchised slaves into what seemed at that time the safe harbor of constitutional right was not, after all, based on abstract doctrines of equality of intellect, but on an inspiring sense of justice (long dormant under the influence of slavery, but thoroughly awakened under the moral stress of the war), which conceded to every man the right of a voice in his own government and the right to an equal opportunity in life to develop such powers as he possessed, however great or small these might be.",authentic,chesnutt,Frederick Douglass,authentic,American,male,black,37.0,0.9870569109916688,0.0482758620689655,0.0,0.6551724137931034,0.5310344827586206,2.396857142857143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0206896551724137,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0344827586206896,0.0137931034482758,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0689655172413793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0206896551724137,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0275862068965517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0620689655172413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0275862068965517,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0206896551724137,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0344827586206896,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0689655172413793,0.0,0.0206896551724137,0.0,0.0,0.1310344827586207,0.0,0.0,0.0551724137931034,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0275862068965517,0.0206896551724137,0.1862068965517241,0.1379310344827586

65,59780,2,"In no respect is the reactionary character of Mr. Dixon's crusade more apparent than in his attempt to attain his ends through his appeals to the worst that there is in men. Mankind has been grouping itself from time immemorial, according to certain physical likenesses, and each race or group has had more or less of prejudice against alien groups. It has been the one struggle of the higher human instincts to enable men, in spite of differences of form, of feature, to find a common bond of sympathy linking mankind together. Uncle Tom's Cabin grappled in the mire of Southern slavery and lifted a despised and helpless race into living sympathy with the white race at the North. To cut these chords of sympathy and re-establish the old order of repulsion, based upon the primitive feeling of race hatred is the first item on Mr. Dixon's programme.",authentic,griggs,The Hindered Hand,authentic,American,male,black,30.2,-0.9474552869796752,0.0206896551724137,0.0,0.6620689655172414,0.5862068965517241,2.4083464566929136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0275862068965517,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0689655172413793,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0344827586206896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0206896551724137,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758620689655172,0.0,0.0,0.0206896551724137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0413793103448275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2275862068965517,0.0620689655172413,0.0,0.0,0.0275862068965517,0.0068965517241379,0.0275862068965517,0.0413793103448275,0.0,0.0413793103448275,0.1103448275862069,0.0137931034482758,0.0068965517241379,0.0068965517241379,0.0137931034482758,0.0,0.0137931034482758,0.0206896551724137,0.1793103448275862,0.1034482758620689

68,58851,2,"Belton began: ""You will remember, Bernard, that there lived, in the early days of the American Republic, a negro scientist who won an international reputation by his skill and erudition. In our school days, we spoke of him often. Because of his learning and consequent usefulness, this negro enjoyed the association of the moving spirits of the revolutionary period. By the publication of a book of science which outranked any other book of the day that treated of the same subject, this negro became a very wealthy man.

73,64155,2,"The churchyard was full of fine trees. On one side a magnificent cedar; on the other a great copper beech. Here and there among the tombs and headstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the long green grass. The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight; the lilac, the hawthorn and the clustering meadowsweet which fringed the edge of the lazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy fragrance. The yellow-grey crumbling walls were green in places with wrinkled harts-tongues, and were topped with sweet-williams and spreading house- leek and stone-crop and wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for the drowsy repose of perfect summer. But amid all that mass of glowing colour the two young figures seated on the grey old tomb stood out conspicuously.

The president of the school, a venerable white minister from the North, had charge of the service that evening. He did not on this occasion preach a sermon, but devoted the hour to discoursing upon the philanthropic work done by the white people of the North for the freedmen of the South. A map of the United States was hanging on the wall, facing the assembled school. On this map there were black dots indicating all places where a school of learning had been planted for the colored people by their white friends of the North.

The birds in the garden were singing lustily. All these sweet and pleasant things found an echo in the major's heart. He stood by the window, and looking toward the rising sun, breathed a silent prayer of thanksgiving. All nature seemed to rejoice in sympathy with his happiness at the fruition of this long-deferred hope, and to predict for this wonderful child a bright and glorious future.

A recent writer has expressed the thought that ""neither material prosperity, nor happiness, nor physical vigor, nor higher intelligence,"" constitute the difference between the 'higher' and the 'lower' races, but that ""those are higher in which broad social instincts and the habit of co-operation exist."" In whatever direction we turn we find evidence of the universality of this law. The voices of science, history and sociology in unbroken harmony sing to the Negro of the necessity of co-operative effort. We must, therefore, proceed at once to the formation of a racial organization truly representative, and able to present the combined resources of the race to the work before us.

But in default of a listener, she had to brood over the change in her life silently as heretofore. It was a happy brooding, although tinged with regret at being separated for an indefinite time from her gentle aunt and dear cousin.

88,59775,1,"If in the marts of toil he offered the labor of his hands, he felt his cheeks tingling from the consciousness that others regarded him as being upon a level with slaves; and at the best the market for his labor was very limited, for the fatted slave stood in his way. So utterly forlorn was the condition of the poor white that the enslaved Negro felt justified in meeting his protruding claim of racial superiority with contemptuous scorn. In the very nature of things the strongest sort of repulsion developed between this class of whites and the Negro slaves. The work, therefore, of overseeing and driving the slaves on the plantations of the more wealthy whites, fitted the habitual mood of the poor white exactly.

This gave employment to masons and carpenters, and involved the sale and purchase of considerable building material. General trade felt the influence of the enhanced prosperity.

A sea of deep dark blue, with the distant horizon tinged with a line of faint white light, and here and there, where its margin was visible through the breaks in the rocky coast, fringed with a line of foam as the waves broke on the rocks or swept in great rollers over the level expanse of sands. The sky was a revelation to me, and seemed to almost obliterate memories of beautiful skies, although I had just come from the south and had felt the intoxication of the Italian night, where in the deep blue sky the nightingaleâ€™s note seems to hang as though its sound and the colour were but different expressions of one common feeling.",authentic,stoker,The Snake's Pass,authentic,British/Irish,male,white,47.0,0.9744867086410522,0.0,0.0,0.6296296296296297,0.5407407407407407,2.45,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0592592592592592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1777777777777777,0.0666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0814814814814814,0.0074074074074074,0.0222222222222222,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.1185185185185185,0.0,0.0,0.0444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0148148148148148,0.1851851851851851,0.1555555555555555

Such a fray bewilders a civilized man, but those familiar with Southern exuberance regard it tranquilly, well knowing the disorder is more apparent than real. Those of the party who were familiar with the scene, looked on highly amused at the bewilderment of the novices. Most of them had acquired the necessary art of not hurrying, and under their direction the examination of the baggage proceeded rapidly. Presently, following a robust porter, they had traversed an open place filled with the benches and chairs of a â€œcafÃ©,â€ and soon the travellers were surprised and amused to find themselves objects of general curiosity.

112,1309,1,"A red quilt with white stars, rather the worse for many washings, covered the bed, and a gay cloth the table, where a judicious arrangement of books and baskets concealed the spots. The little air-tight stove was banished, and a pair of ancient andirons shone in the fire-light. Grandma's last and largest braided rug lay on the hearth, and her brass candlesticks adorned the bureau, over the mirror of which was festooned a white muslin skirt, tied up with Merry's red sash. This piece of elegance gave the last touch to her room, she thought, and she was very proud of it, setting forth all her small store of trinkets in a large shell, with an empty scent bottle, and a clean tidy over the pincushion. On the walls she hung three old-fashioned pictures, which she ventured to borrow from the garret till better could be found.",authentic,alcott,jack and jill,authentic,American,female,white,29.8,0.9930210709571838,0.0,0.0486111111111111,0.6805555555555556,0.5625,2.723333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0486111111111111,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0486111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902777777777777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0416666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2152777777777778,0.0694444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0138888888888888,0.0763888888888889,0.0069444444444444,0.0277777777777777,0.0,0.0069444444444444,0.1111111111111111,0.0069444444444444,0.0069444444444444,0.0138888888888888,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0347222222222222,0.0208333333333333,0.1180555555555555,0.1597222222222222
113,59127,1,"Erma sat listening in amazement at the revelation of the adroit effort to capture young Lawson's heart, she being designated as the culpable party. When Erma's beauty was taken into account, together with the brilliancy and power of insinuation found in the correspondence, the auditors were prepared to account for the downfall of young Lawson. The defense here rested its case. To the surprise of all, the Commonwealth's attorney signified his purpose to offer testimony in rebuttal. He also suggested to the attorneys for the defense, in a whispered conference, that Mrs. Lawson, the wife of the Ex-Governor, be requested to retire in view of disclosures to be made. The retirement of Mrs. Lawson brought excitement to the highest pitch, and sensational developments were momentarily expected. Dolly Smith is called as a witness and takes her seat. She casts a look of malicious triumph in the direction of the Ex-Governor.",authentic,griggs,Overshadowed,authentic,American,male,black,19.125,0.9936099648475648,0.0136986301369863,0.0205479452054794,0.636986301369863,0.5684931506849316,2.3248818897637795,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.1232876712328767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0410958904109589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0616438356164383,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0547945205479452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260273972602739,0.0273972602739726,0.0,0.0,0.0410958904109589,0.0547945205479452,0.0136986301369863,0.0547945205479452,0.0068493150684931,0.0273972602739726,0.0753424657534246,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0342465753424657,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0205479452054794,0.1506849315068493,0.1438356164383561

There was a newly-lighted fire in the unused grate; and Kester was in the kitchen, with his clogs off his feet, so as not to dirty the spotless floor, stirring here and there, and trying in his awkward way to make things look home-like and cheerful.",authentic,gaskell,SYLVIA'S LOVERS,authentic,British/Irish,female,white,28.8,0.9962536692619324,0.0212765957446808,0.0,0.6524822695035462,0.5673758865248227,2.528837209302325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0141843971631205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0638297872340425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.1347517730496454,0.0,0.0141843971631205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0283687943262411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0141843971631205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0496453900709219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0354609929078014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0212765957446808,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2127659574468085,0.0496453900709219,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0496453900709219,0.0425531914893617,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.1134751773049645,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0283687943262411,0.1418439716312056,0.1489361702127659

At one side, beyond this barren area, lay a kitchen garden, enclosed by a paling fence. The colonel had never thought of young Dudley as being at all energetic, but so ill-kept a place argued shiftlessness in a marked degree. When the carriage had drawn up in front of the house, the colonel became aware of two figures on the long piazza.

The autumn sun, rising over the ----shire hills, disclosed a pleasant country; woods brown and mellow varied the fields from which the harvest had been lately carried; a river, gliding between the woods, caught on its surface the somewhat cold gleam of the October sun and sky; at frequent intervals along the banks of the river, tall, cylindrical chimneys, almost like slender round towers, indicated the factories which the trees half concealed; here and there mansions, similar to Crimsworth Hall, occupied agreeable sites on the hill-side; the country wore, on the whole, a cheerful, active, fertile look.",authentic,bronte,THE_PROFESSOR,authentic,British/Irish,female,white,24.0,0.9974421262741088,0.0,0.0,0.7214285714285714,0.65,2.6813821138211384,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.0214285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.1285714285714285,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0071428571428571,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0214285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2357142857142857,0.0857142857142857,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0214285714285714,0.0642857142857142,0.0214285714285714,0.0357142857142857,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.1214285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0928571428571428,0.1642857142857142
127,59696,1,"""That,"" said he to himself, ""will solve a large part of the Negro's side of the problem, but how great an army of carpenters can hammer the spirit of repression out of those who hold that the eternal repression of the Negro is the nation's only safeguard? What worker in iron can fashion a key that will open the door to that world of higher activities, the world of moral and spiritual forces which alone woos Eunice's spirit and mine? What welder of steel can beat into one the discordant soul forces of willing Negroes and unwilling whites, the really pivotal point of the problem? Really pressing is the need of industrial training for our people, but my peculiar case calls for something that must come from Lincoln the emancipator rather than from Lincoln the rail-splitter.""",authentic,griggs,The Hindered Hand,authentic,American,male,black,34.75,-0.1898216605186462,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.6444444444444445,0.5111111111111111,2.432204724409449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0074074074074074,0.037037037037037,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.1037037037037037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0888888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0518518518518518,0.0,0.0,0.0444444444444444,0.0148148148148148,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0222222222222222,0.0888888888888888,0.0074074074074074,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.0,0.0,0.0148148148148148,0.0148148148148148,0.1555555555555555,0.1481481481481481

'Absence makes the heart grow fonder.' In Stephen's mind had been but a very mustard-seed of fondness. But new lights were breaking for her; and all of them, in greater or lesser degree, shone in turn on the memory of the pretty self-willed dominant boy, who now grew larger and more masculine in stature under the instance of each successive light. Stephen knew the others fairly well through and through. The usual mixture of good and evil, of strength and weakness, of purpose and vacillation, was quite within the scope of her own feeling and of her observation.",authentic,stoker,THE MAN,authentic,British/Irish,male,white,23.666666666666668,0.9937250018119812,0.0144927536231884,0.0434782608695652,0.644927536231884,0.5144927536231884,2.273015873015873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0144927536231884,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0652173913043478,0.0,0.0,0.0144927536231884,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.072463768115942,0.0144927536231884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0144927536231884,0.0,0.0289855072463768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0144927536231884,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014492753623188,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0144927536231884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0072463768115942,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536231884057971,0.0289855072463768,0.0,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0579710144927536,0.0072463768115942,0.0072463768115942,0.0,0.0072463768115942,0.0579710144927536,0.0289855072463768,0.0072463768115942,0.0507246376811594,0.0,0.0,0.0217391304347826,0.0507246376811594,0.2028985507246377,0.1014492753623188

Absorbed in the contemplation of their doubtful present and their uncertain future, they gave little thought to the past,--it was a dark story, which they would willingly forget. He knew the timeworn explanation that the Ku-Klux movement, in the main, was merely an ebullition of boyish spirits, begun to amuse young white men by playing upon the fears and superstitions of ignorant negroes. Here, however, was its tragic side,--the old wound still bleeding, the fruit of one tragedy, the seed of another.

CHAPTER 54  Past and Present  Being left to myself, up there, I went on picking out old houses in the distant town, and calling back their former inmates out of the moldy past. Among them I presently recognized the house of the father of Lem Hackett (fictitious name). It carried me back more than a generation in a moment, and landed me in the midst of a time when the happenings of life were not the natural and logical results of great general laws, but of special orders, and were freighted with very precise and distinct purposes--partly punitive in intent, partly admonitory; and usually local in application.

On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished. Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised him.",authentic,bronte,JANE_EYRE_AN_AUTOBIOGRAPHY,authentic,British/Irish,female,white,29.4,-0.9976524710655212,0.0419580419580419,0.0,0.7482517482517482,0.5944055944055944,2.8266153846153843,0.0139860139860139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0559440559440559,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0279720279720279,0.0,0.0,0.0209790209790209,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0769230769230769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0139860139860139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0209790209790209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0139860139860139,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0209790209790209,0.0,0.0139860139860139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0139860139860139,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0139860139860139,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447552447552447,0.0419580419580419,0.0,0.0,0.0069930069930069,0.0559440559440559,0.0489510489510489,0.0489510489510489,0.0139860139860139,0.0069930069930069,0.0839160839160839,0.0,0.0,0.0419580419580419,0.0,0.0,0.0139860139860139,0.0559440559440559,0.1328671328671328,0.1608391608391608

VIII  THE COURTSHIP  In a few weeks the echoes of the tournament died away, and Rena's life settled down into a pleasant routine, which she found much more comfortable than her recent spectacular prominence. Her queenship, while not entirely forgiven by the ladies of the town, had gained for her a temporary social prominence. Among her own sex, Mrs. Newberry proved a warm and enthusiastic friend.

There was a great gathering at dinner, and, as usual, one heard all sorts of languages. The table d'hÃ´te was served by waitresses dressed in the quaint and comely costume of the Swiss peasants. This consists of a simple gros de laine, trimmed with ashes of roses, with overskirt of scare bleu ventre saint gris, cut bias on the off-side, with facings of petit polonaise and narrow insertions of pÃ¢te de foie gras backstitched to the mise en sce`ne in the form of a jeu d'esprit. It gives to the wearer a singularly piquant and alluring aspect.

His steady tramp came to a halt, and stopping by a wayside spring, he pointed to a mossy stone, saying with no hint of superior powers--  ""We are tired, let us rest."" Sylvia dropped down at once, and for a few minutes neither spoke, for the air was full of sounds more pertinent to the summer night than human voices. From the copse behind them, came the coo of wood-pigeons, from the grass at their feet the plaintive chirp of crickets; a busy breeze whispered through the willow, the little spring dripped musically from the rock, and across the meadows came the sweet chime of a bell.",authentic,alcott,moods,authentic,American,female,white,37.5,-0.9948996305465698,0.027027027027027,0.0135135135135135,0.6891891891891891,0.5472972972972973,2.533333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0405405405405405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0405405405405405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.1081081081081081,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0472972972972973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2162162162162162,0.0675675675675675,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.081081081081081,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.0,0.0878378378378378,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0405405405405405,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0405405405405405,0.027027027027027,0.1554054054054054,0.1554054054054054
135,1907,1,"A book for girls being wanted by a certain publisher, she hastily scribbled a little story describing a few scenes and adventures in the lives of herself and sisters, though boys were more in her line, and with very slight hopes of success sent it out to seek its fortune. Things always went by contraries with Jo. Her first book, laboured over for years, and launched full of the high hopes and ambitious dreams of youth, foundered on its voyage, though the wreck continued to float long afterward, to the profit of the publisher at least. The hastily written story, sent away with no thought beyond the few dollars it might bring, sailed with a fair wind and a wise pilot at the helm into public favour, and came home heavily laden with an unexpected cargo of gold and glory.",authentic,alcott,jo boys,authentic,American,female,white,35.0,0.9610987305641174,0.0,0.0285714285714285,0.6785714285714286,0.5642857142857143,2.4065833333333333,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0428571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0071428571428571,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0428571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0357142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0214285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642857142857142,0.0928571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.0214285714285714,0.05,0.0142857142857142,0.0428571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0642857142857142,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0214285714285714,0.0285714285714285,0.1785714285714285,0.1142857142857142

At dinner Athlyne was placed between Mrs. Ogilvie and Joy, Colonel Ogilvie being next his daughter and Miss Hayes next her sister. Thus Aunt Judy, being opposite both her niece and the guest, could watch them both without seeming to stare. In the early part of the dinner she was abnormally, for her, silent; but later on, when she felt that things were going dully with some of the party, she manifested her usual buoyancy of spirits.

One accomplished creature with learning radiating from every pore, delivered a charming little essay on the strong-minded women of antiquity; then, taking labor into the region of art, painted delightful pictures of the time when all would work harmoniously together in an Ideal Republic, where each did the task she liked, and was paid for it in liberty, equality, and fraternity.",authentic,alcott,Work,authentic,American,female,white,62.5,0.9961281418800354,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.7096774193548387,0.5403225806451613,2.372105263157895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032258064516129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0161290322580645,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0403225806451612,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032258064516129,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0564516129032258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0483870967741935,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0161290322580645,0.0161290322580645,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.064516129032258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0161290322580645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0080645161290322,0.0161290322580645,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0161290322580645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854838709677419,0.0564516129032258,0.0,0.0,0.0161290322580645,0.0725806451612903,0.032258064516129,0.0241935483870967,0.0,0.0,0.1129032258064516,0.0,0.0,0.0403225806451612,0.0,0.0,0.0483870967741935,0.0161290322580645,0.1693548387096774,0.1048387096774193

The Christian was to go into the city, he set forth, and sit upon a throne singing God's praise, looking out of the window of heaven while the sun was covered with sackcloth and ashes and the moon was dripping away in blood. His very last remarks were made sitting down, in representation of the final rest of the Christian in the midst of the stirring scenes depicted. The tumultuous scene which accompanied and followed this highly dramatic peroration beggars description.

After supper they sat out upon the piazza. The lights within were turned down low, so that the moths and other insects might not be attracted. Sweet odours from the garden filled the air.

XXXII   THE STORM BREAKS  The Wellington riot began at three o'clock in the afternoon of a day as fair as was ever selected for a deed of darkness.

The other is the crackling of a burning house in the night's dead hours, the piteous cries of pain and terror from the lips of wounded babes; the despairing, heart-rending, maddening shrieks of the wife and mother; the harrowing groans of the dying husband and father, and the gladsome shout of the fiendish mob of white American citizens, who have wrought the havoc just described, a deed sufficiently horrible to make Satan blush and hell hastily hide her face in shame.",authentic,griggs,Imperium in Imperio,authentic,American,male,black,47.66666666666666,0.9843824505805968,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.6879432624113475,0.574468085106383,2.49024,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0283687943262411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0638297872340425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205673758865248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0141843971631205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709219858156028,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0141843971631205,0.0141843971631205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0070921985815602,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0354609929078014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2482269503546099,0.0709219858156028,0.0,0.0,0.0354609929078014,0.0070921985815602,0.0283687943262411,0.0141843971631205,0.0141843971631205,0.0141843971631205,0.1134751773049645,0.0,0.0,0.0283687943262411,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602,0.0212765957446808,0.1276595744680851,0.1489361702127659

The very opposite of Mr. Dixon is Professor Nathaniel F. Shaler, of Harvard, himself a Southerner, who approaches this same grave question of the relation of the races and seeks to prepare the American people for the consideration of the subject free from the distorting influence of prejudice. A SERIOUS HANDICAP. The cultivation of race hatreds on the part of Mr. Dixon and others who labor with him, if successful will react on the American people sadly to their detriment. The wonderful activity of American industries call loudly for the world as a market for their goods. The dark races of the world, now backward in the matter of manufacturing, must largely furnish these markets.",authentic,griggs,The Hindered Hand,authentic,American,male,black,23.83333333333333,-0.98250150680542,0.0215827338129496,0.0,0.6402877697841727,0.5323741007194245,2.291864406779661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0359712230215827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014388489208633,0.0,0.0,0.014388489208633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014388489208633,0.1223021582733813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0215827338129496,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007194244604316,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.014388489208633,0.014388489208633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014388489208633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0215827338129496,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870503597122302,0.0863309352517985,0.0,0.0,0.0287769784172661,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0215827338129496,0.1151079136690647,0.0,0.0071942446043165,0.0719424460431654,0.0,0.0,0.014388489208633,0.0215827338129496,0.1942446043165467,0.1726618705035971

In spite of the gray monotone to which the paintless years had reduced the once white weatherboarding and green Venetian blinds, the house possessed a certain stateliness of style which was independent of circumstance, and a solidity of construction that resisted sturdily the disintegrating hand of time.

The sun, remembering his many unfinished tasks of the previous day, and suspicious ever of the work of the night, came bolting upward and hurled his myriad pointed spear to strike down the morning mists that sulkily obscured his vision. The awakened world came rushing forth from the land of sleep and dream.

Sancho sat at the open window, watching the old cat wash her face, and trying to imitate her with his great ruffled paw, so awkwardly that Ben laughed; and Sanch, to hide his confusion at being caught, made one bound from chair to bed, and licked his master's face so energetically that the boy dived under the bedclothes to escape from the rough tongue.",authentic,alcott,Under the lilacs,authentic,American,female,white,74.0,0.3983318507671356,0.0408163265306122,0.0136054421768707,0.7414965986394558,0.5714285714285714,2.687734375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0340136054421768,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816326530612244,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0340136054421768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0068027210884353,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0068027210884353,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2312925170068027,0.0476190476190476,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0544217687074829,0.0272108843537414,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.1020408163265306,0.0,0.0,0.0476190476190476,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0272108843537414,0.1360544217687075,0.1156462585034013
170,59202,1,"In this period of transition even the judiciary was sometimes honeycombed with politics. The same blighting shadow cast itself over the prison system where appointees were selected with regard to their ""political pull."" This state of affairs will account to you for the latitude allowed to the successful politician, Lanier, a product of his times, in his dealing with the condemned Negro, John Wysong. Another factor in rendering the substitution so successful, was as follows: Under the system of slavery, the whites, being interested in the Negroes from many points of view, habitually scrutinized their features and were adepts at distinguishing one Negro from another.

Round the neck it was delicately embroidered in pure gold with tiny sprays of sycamore; and round the feet, similarly worked, was an endless line of lotus plants of unequal height, and with all the graceful abandon of natural growth. Across the body, but manifestly not surrounding it, was a girdle of jewels.

Well, he had imagined her just as pure and fine, and she had deliberately, with a negro's low cunning, deceived him into believing that she was a white girl. The pretended confession of the brother, in which he had spoken of the humble origin of the family, had been, consciously or unconsciously, the most disingenuous feature of the whole miserable performance.

This Stele was a great slab of lapis lazuli, cut all over with hieroglyphic figures of small size and of much beauty. The cutting was filled in with some cement of exceeding fineness, and of the colour of pure vermilion. The inscription began:  â€œâ€˜Tera, Queen of the Egypts, daughter of Antef, Monarch of the North and the South.â€™ â€˜Daughter of the Sun,â€™ â€˜Queen of the Diademsâ€™. â€œIt then set out, in full record, the history of her life and reign. â€œThe signs of sovereignty were given with a truly feminine profusion of adornment.

The house in which the colored school was held was, in former times, a house of worship for the white Baptists of Winchester. It was a long, plain, frame structure, painted white. Many years prior to the opening of the colored school it had been condemned as unsafe by the town authorities, whereupon the white Baptists had abandoned it for a more beautiful modern structure.

Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, â€˜the observed of all observers.â€™ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly. â€œIn such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last.",authentic,twain,THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TOM_SAWYER,authentic,American,male,white,25.166666666666668,0.997075378894806,0.0,0.0492957746478873,0.7535211267605634,0.6126760563380281,2.4628225806451614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0915492957746478,0.0,0.0,0.0140845070422535,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0211267605633802,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0492957746478873,0.0,0.0,0.0352112676056338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0140845070422535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0140845070422535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0211267605633802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2112676056338028,0.056338028169014,0.0,0.0,0.028169014084507,0.0211267605633802,0.0211267605633802,0.028169014084507,0.0,0.056338028169014,0.1408450704225352,0.0,0.0140845070422535,0.028169014084507,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.028169014084507,0.0352112676056338,0.1267605633802817,0.1267605633802817

I found, it is true, few elements of the â€œgood fellowâ€ or the â€œfine fellowâ€ in him; scant sparkles of the spirit which loves to flash over the wine cup, or which kindles the passions to a destroying fire; but I saw in the soil of his heart healthy and swelling germs of compassion, affection, fidelity. I discovered in the garden of his intellect a rich growth of wholesome principles--reason, justice, moral courage, promised, if not blighted, a fertile bearing. So I bestowed on his large forehead, and on his cheek--still pale with tears--a proud and contented kiss, and sent him away comforted.",authentic,bronte,THE_PROFESSOR,authentic,British/Irish,female,white,37.25,0.9824689030647278,0.0633802816901408,0.0,0.647887323943662,0.5563380281690141,2.5384615384615383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0352112676056338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0492957746478873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0492957746478873,0.0,0.0,0.0140845070422535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0140845070422535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633802816901408,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0352112676056338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0140845070422535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0211267605633802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633802816901408,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0140845070422535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0211267605633802,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2112676056338028,0.0633802816901408,0.0,0.0,0.0070422535211267,0.0845070422535211,0.0070422535211267,0.0211267605633802,0.0,0.0211267605633802,0.1126760563380281,0.0,0.0,0.028169014084507,0.0,0.0,0.0422535211267605,0.0422535211267605,0.1408450704225352,0.0985915492957746

The scene rapidly brightened into light and color as the blaze sprang up, showing the little kettle slung gipsywise on forked sticks, and the supper prettily set forth in a leafy table-service on a smooth, flat stone. Soon four pairs of wet feet surrounded the fire; an agreeable oblivion of _meum_ and _tuum_ concerning plates, knives, and cups did away with etiquette, and every one was in a comfortable state of weariness, which rendered the thought of bed so pleasant that they deferred their enjoyment of the reality, as children keep the best bite till the last.

Sleep went quite away. I used to rise in the night, look round for her, beseech her earnestly to return. A rattle of the window, a cry of the blast only repliedâ€”Sleep never came! I err. She came once, but in anger. Impatient of my importunity she brought with her an avenging dream.

But Natchez-on-top-of-the-hill is attractive; has always been attractive. Even Mrs. Trollope (1827) had to confess its charms:  'At one or two points the wearisome level line is relieved by bluffs, as they call the short intervals of high ground.

Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird.

205,19657,1,"It is perhaps fitting, before we take leave of Douglass, to give some estimate of the remarkable oratory which gave him his hold upon the past generation. For, while his labors as editor and in other directions were of great value to the cause of freedom, it is upon his genius as an orator that his fame must ultimately rest. While Douglass's color put him in a class by himself among great orators, and although his slave past threw around him an element of romance that added charm to his eloquence, these were mere incidental elements of distinction. The North was full of fugitive slaves, and more than one had passionately proclaimed his wrongs. There were several colored orators who stood high in the councils of the abolitionists and did good service for the cause of humanity. Douglass possessed, in large measure, the physical equipment most impressive in an orator.",authentic,chesnutt,Frederick Douglass,authentic,American,male,black,25.166666666666668,0.9711536765098572,0.0733333333333333,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.5333333333333333,2.357153284671533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0266666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0533333333333333,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.0133333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0066666666666666,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.06,0.0,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0733333333333333,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0066666666666666,0.0133333333333333,0.1133333333333333,0.0133333333333333,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0066666666666666,0.0466666666666666,0.0466666666666666,0.1933333333333333,0.0933333333333333

The legality of the marriage had never been questioned. It had been fully consummated by twenty years of subsequent cohabitation. No amount of social persecution had ever shaken the position of the husband. With an iron will he had stayed on in the town, a living protest against the established customs of the South, so rudely interrupted for a few short years; and, though his children were negroes, though he had never appeared in public with his wife, no one had ever questioned the validity of his marriage or the legitimacy of his offspring.",authentic,chesnutt,The Marrow of Tradition,authentic,American,male,black,29.8,0.9086132049560548,0.0408163265306122,0.0136054421768707,0.6394557823129252,0.5510204081632653,2.361214285714285,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0408163265306122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0476190476190476,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0952380952380952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0068027210884353,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748299319727891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1972789115646258,0.0340136054421768,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0612244897959183,0.0,0.0748299319727891,0.0,0.0,0.0884353741496598,0.0,0.0,0.0884353741496598,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0340136054421768,0.1700680272108843,0.1700680272108843

209,72454,1,"We returned to Honolulu, and from thence sailed to the island of Maui, and spent several weeks there very pleasantly. I still remember, with a sense of indolent luxury, a picnicing excursion up a romantic gorge there, called the Iao Valley. The trail lay along the edge of a brawling stream in the bottom of the gorgeâ€”a shady route, for it was well roofed with the verdant domes of forest trees. Through openings in the foliage we glimpsed picturesque scenery that revealed ceaseless changes and new charms with every step of our progress. Perpendicular walls from one to three thousand feet high guarded the way, and were sumptuously plumed with varied foliage, in places, and in places swathed in waving ferns.",authentic,twain,ROUGHING_IT,authentic,American,male,white,24.6,0.9980011582374572,0.0,0.0,0.7107438016528925,0.5702479338842975,2.564040404040404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0413223140495867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0,0.0413223140495867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0743801652892562,0.0,0.0165289256198347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0413223140495867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0495867768595041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0165289256198347,0.0,0.0330578512396694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0165289256198347,0.0,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024793388429752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066115702479339,0.0909090909090909,0.0,0.0,0.0330578512396694,0.0495867768595041,0.0082644628099173,0.0413223140495867,0.0,0.0082644628099173,0.0826446280991735,0.0,0.0,0.0495867768595041,0.0,0.0,0.024793388429752,0.0082644628099173,0.1735537190082644,0.1239669421487603
210,19567,1,"IV   In 1841 Douglass entered upon that epoch of his life which brought the hitherto obscure refugee prominently before the public, and in which his services as anti-slavery orator and reformer constitute his chief claim to enduring recollection. Millions of negroes whose lives had been far less bright than Douglass's had lived and died in slavery. Thousands of fugitives under assumed names were winning a precarious livelihood in the free States and trembling in constant fear of the slave-catcher. Some of these were doing noble work in assisting others to escape from bondage. Mr. Siebert, in his _Underground Railroad_, mentions one fugitive slave, John Mason by name, who assisted thirteen hundred others to escape from Kentucky. Another picturesque fugitive was Harriet Tubman, who devoted her life to this work with a courage, skill, and success that won her a wide reputation among the friends of freedom.",authentic,chesnutt,Frederick Douglass,authentic,American,male,black,24.5,0.9992182850837708,0.0285714285714285,0.0142857142857142,0.7142857142857143,0.5857142857142857,2.3978448275862068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0214285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0357142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0357142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0428571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2214285714285714,0.0857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0285714285714285,0.0785714285714285,0.0357142857142857,0.0285714285714285,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0785714285714285,0.0071428571428571,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0071428571428571,0.0357142857142857,0.1714285714285714,0.0928571428571428

The exposure for several hours in her wet clothing to the damps and miasma of the swamp had brought on an attack of brain fever. The next morning, she was delirious. One of the children took word to the schoolhouse that the teacher was sick and there would be no school that day. A number of curious and sympathetic people came in from time to time and suggested various remedies, several of which old Mrs. Johnson, with catholic impartiality, administered to the helpless teacher, who from delirium gradually sunk into a heavy stupor scarcely distinguishable from sleep. It was predicted that she would probably be well in the morning; if not, it would then be time to consider seriously the question of sending for a doctor.",authentic,chesnutt,THE HOUSE BEHIND THE CEDARS,authentic,American,male,black,24.666666666666668,-0.9960129857063292,0.0,0.0340136054421768,0.6326530612244898,0.54421768707483,2.4468345323741008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748299319727891,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0068027210884353,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0476190476190476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0408163265306122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2176870748299319,0.0340136054421768,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0544217687074829,0.0068027210884353,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.1156462585034013,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0476190476190476,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0204081632653061,0.1700680272108843,0.1224489795918367

She was in riding-habit of hunting scarlet cloth; her black hat was tipped forward by piled-up masses red-golden hair. Round her neck was a white lawn scarf in the fashion of a man's hunting-stock, close fitting, and sinking into a gold-buttoned waistcoat of snowy twill. As she sat with the long skirt across her left arm her tiny black top-boots appeared underneath. Her gauntleted gloves were of white buckskin; her riding-whip was plaited of white leather, topped with ivory and banded with gold.

Her father thought, as he looked at her and heard the ring of her voice, that he had never seen her look better or happier. She was full of spirits, gay, sweet, tender; and yet there was over her such a grace of gentle gravity that the old man felt himself saying to himself:  â€œMy little girl is a woman!â€  That mellow afternoon was to her lovely; the trees and shrubs, the flowers, the fields. The singing of the birds was ethereal music; the lights and shadows were the personal manifestation of Natureâ€™s God.

Yet they remained friends, were great admirers of each other, and lived each in the hope of converting the other to his way of thinking. On the question of racial connection Ensal was really proud of the fact that he was a Negro, and felt that had he been entrusted with the determining of his racial affinity he would have chosen membership in the Negro race. Earl accepted the fact of his connection with the Negro race as a matter of course, had no desire to alter the relationship, and felt neither dejection nor elation on account thereof.",authentic,griggs,The Hindered Hand,authentic,American,male,black,29.2,0.9871910214424132,0.0410958904109589,0.0,0.589041095890411,0.5273972602739726,2.276044776119403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0342465753424657,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0890410958904109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0136986301369863,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0684931506849315,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2054794520547945,0.0410958904109589,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.1095890410958904,0.0205479452054794,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0890410958904109,0.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0,0.0,0.047945205479452,0.0342465753424657,0.1575342465753424,0.1575342465753424
231,60181,1,"When society is in a transitional state, men of imagination are able through clear comprehension of the forces at work, to project themselves into the new era, and, seeing where the movement tends, place themselves at the head of the procession. Those deficient in this faculty cannot perceive the ultimate goal of the processes forming before their very eyes; and, even when new conditions have come bearing the stamp of immortality, they yet are dreaming of a relapse into old conditions that are gone forever. They are thus unfit for the duties of the new era, being devotees of the past. The ruling of the world is, therefore, left, as Napoleon asserts, to men of imagination.

As the windows faced north, any light that came was a fixed grey light without any of the rosy possibility of dawn which comes in the eastern quarter of heaven.

240,67802,1,"Descriptions of such a work as this must necessarily be imperfect, yet they are of value. The top of the Trunk is arched; the arch is a perfect half-circle, in the Roman style of architecture, for in the then rapid decadence of Greek art, the rising influence of Rome was already beginning to be felt in the art of the Republic. The Trunk is bound or bordered with leather all around where the lid joins the main body. Many critics consider this leather too cold in tone; but I consider this its highest merit, since it was evidently made so to emphasize by contrast the impassioned fervor of the hasp. The highlights in this part of the work are cleverly managed, the MOTIF is admirably subordinated to the ground tints, and the technique is very fine. The brass nail-heads are in the purest style of the early Renaissance.",authentic,twain,A TRAMP ABROAD,authentic,American,male,white,24.666666666666668,0.9984999895095824,0.0,0.0,0.6301369863013698,0.5753424657534246,2.2825925925925925,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0273972602739726,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.1438356164383561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0410958904109589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0684931506849315,0.0,0.0,0.0342465753424657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0,0.0,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2054794520547945,0.0273972602739726,0.0,0.0,0.0205479452054794,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.047945205479452,0.0342465753424657,0.0410958904109589,0.0821917808219178,0.0068493150684931,0.0136986301369863,0.0684931506849315,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0068493150684931,0.1506849315068493,0.1917808219178082

At times I could not see her face, for the evening was closing in and the driving clouds overhead, which kept piling up in great masses along the western horizon, shut out the remnants of the day.

Yes, it was morning; the bright, balmy morning of summer; the minutest leaf, the smallest blade of grass, was instinct with life. The ant crept forth to her daily toil, the butterfly fluttered and basked in the warm rays of the sun; myriads of insects spread their transparent wings, and revelled in their brief but happy existence.

It was the arm and voice of Aunt Mollie Marston, who had followed Erma out of the church.",authentic,griggs,Overshadowed,authentic,American,male,black,24.83333333333333,0.9445950984954834,0.0,0.1013513513513513,0.6418918918918919,0.5540540540540541,2.7765648854961835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0337837837837837,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608108108108108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608108108108108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.027027027027027,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.0878378378378378,0.0337837837837837,0.027027027027027,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0675675675675675,0.0,0.0,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.0,0.0472972972972973,0.0743243243243243,0.1756756756756756,0.0945945945945946

The body was taken from Cedar Hill to the church at half-past nine in the morning; and from that hour until noon thousands of persons, including many white people, passed in double file through the building and viewed the body, which was in charge of a guard of honor composed of members of a colored camp of the Sons of Veterans.

He had never minced his words in the United States, and he now handled without gloves the government whose laws had driven him from its borders. From Scotland Douglass went to England, where he found still another great reform movement nearing a triumphant conclusion. The Anti-corn Law League, after many years of labor, under the leadership of Richard Cobden and John Bright, for the abolition of the protective tariff on wheat and other kinds of grain for food, had brought its agitation to a successful issue; and on June 26, 1846, the Corn Laws were repealed.",authentic,chesnutt,Frederick Douglass,authentic,American,male,black,31.75,0.9964186549186708,0.0483870967741935,0.0,0.7016129032258065,0.5806451612903226,2.355238095238095,0.0161290322580645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0241935483870967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0483870967741935,0.0,0.0,0.0241935483870967,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0241935483870967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887096774193548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0241935483870967,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032258064516129,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0161290322580645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0241935483870967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0080645161290322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419354838709677,0.0806451612903225,0.0,0.0,0.0161290322580645,0.0806451612903225,0.0161290322580645,0.032258064516129,0.0,0.0,0.0725806451612903,0.0,0.0,0.0403225806451612,0.0,0.0,0.032258064516129,0.032258064516129,0.1370967741935483,0.1209677419354838

265,20108,1,"Even a healthy social instinct might be perverted into an unhealthy and unjust prejudice; most things evil were the perversion of good. The feeling with which the colonel thus came for the first time directly in contact, a smouldering fire capable always of being fanned into flame, had been greatly excited by the political campaign which began about the third month after his arrival in Clarendon. An ambitious politician in a neighbouring State had led a successful campaign on the issue of Negro disfranchisement.

270,19876,1,"The hope was expressed that Colonel French, who had recently sold out to a syndicate his bagging mills in Connecticut, might seek investments in the South, whose vast undeveloped resources needed only the fructifying flow of abundant capital to make it blossom like the rose. The New South, the _Anglo-Saxon_ declared, was happy to welcome capital and enterprise, and hoped that Colonel French might find, in Clarendon, an agreeable residence, and an attractive opening for his trained business energies. That something of the kind was not unlikely, might be gathered from the fact that Colonel French had already repurchased, from William Nichols, a worthy negro barber, the old French mansion, and had taken into his service a former servant of the family, thus foreshadowing a renewal of local ties and a prolonged residence. The conduct of the colonel in the matter of his old servant was warmly commended.",authentic,chesnutt,The Colonel's Dream,authentic,American,male,black,37.0,0.9993085265159608,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.6190476190476191,0.5986394557823129,2.377265625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0340136054421768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0340136054421768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884353741496598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0408163265306122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136054421768707,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0272108843537414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2108843537414966,0.0476190476190476,0.0,0.0,0.0408163265306122,0.0612244897959183,0.0136054421768707,0.0544217687074829,0.0,0.0,0.1292517006802721,0.0,0.0,0.0408163265306122,0.0,0.0,0.0068027210884353,0.0272108843537414,0.1360544217687075,0.1360544217687075

Proceeding along a mountain gorge, our travellers found the path straitened between the impending mountain on one side and a rapid and sparkling stream on the other. On the opposite side of the ravine the precipices rose abruptly from the very edge of the water.

293,19799,1,"Graciella went to the piano and with great boldness of touch struck the bizarre opening chords and then launched into the grotesque words of the latest New York ""coon song,"" one of the first and worst of its kind, and the other young people joined in the chorus. It was the first discordant note. At home, the colonel subscribed to the opera, and enjoyed the music. A plantation song of the olden time, as he remembered it, borne upon the evening air, when sung by the tired slaves at the end of their day of toil, would have been pleasing, with its simple melody, its plaintive minor strains, its notes of vague longing; but to the colonel's senses there was to-night no music in this hackneyed popular favourite. In a metropolitan music hall, gaudily bedecked and brilliantly lighted, it would have been tolerable from the lips of a black-face comedian.",authentic,chesnutt,The Colonel's Dream,authentic,American,male,black,30.2,0.9604608416557312,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.6554054054054054,0.5472972972972973,2.3951181102362207,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0405405405405405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.1148648648648648,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608108108108108,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0067567567567567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094594594594594,0.0405405405405405,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0743243243243243,0.0067567567567567,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0202702702702702,0.1351351351351351,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.0202702702702702,0.0,0.0,0.027027027027027,0.0337837837837837,0.1418918918918918,0.1486486486486486
