He was the kind of urchin you'd find skulking about riverbanks at all ungodly hours, stewing in the sort of innocent mischief that'd make saintly mothers shake their heads. His face was sun-kissed, splashed with freckles as if someone tossed a handful of sand at him. Grinning, Billy would tell you it's the dust from all those adventures; those tall tales that would charm the socks off you and make your wisdom teeth itch.

It waits, patience itself, letting the squawkers squawk till they're red in their faces, and then, when the silence does eventually come, it presents itself, modest, and demure, and all the more potent for its politeness.",synthetic,twain,Act like Mark Twain and write an original paragraph utilizing his style.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,23.6,0.9057548642158508,0.035714286,0,0.7857142857142857,0.5446428571428571,2.5207070707070707,0.008928571,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0.044642857,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0.035714286,0,0.017857143,0.008928571,0.008928571,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0.008928571,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0.017857143,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026785714,0,0.008928571,0.053571429,0,0.008928571,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017857143,0,0,0.008928571,0,0.017857143,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0.017857143,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026785714,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1607142857142857,0.017857143,0,0,0.026785714,0.017857143,0.044642857,0.017857143,0.026785714,0.0625,0.080357143,0.017857143,0,0.053571429,0.017857143,0,0.098214286,0.026785714,0.1339285714285714,0.1160714285714285

His sun-baked, wrinkled face - scrawled with lines of laughter, weather, and age â€“ did little to hide the spark in his twinkling eyes when the spirit of a story gripped him right. With a weathered straw hat perched atop his mop of silver hair, he narrated in a rich, gravelly voice that danced to a rhythm older than the very rocks around us. There was magic in his words, a wild, recklessly free spirit that made us youngsters yearn for adventures we'd never dared to dream. It wasn't just tales he spun, but portals he opened to a universe where normal folks like us could be mighty heroes riding the surging currents of life, tossing the mundane overboard, and rescuing our dreams from the vast depths of the mighty river of fate.",synthetic,twain,Write an original paragraph in the style of Mark Twain.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,32.4,0.9967517852783204,0.057324841,0,0.7261146496815286,0.5668789808917197,2.5889705882352945,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0.038216561,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0.012738854,0,0.006369427,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0.006369427,0,0,0,0.012738854,0,0,0.006369427,0,0.006369427,0.063694268,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01910828,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044585987,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012738854,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0.006369427,0,0.012738854,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0.006369427,0.006369427,0,0.012738854,0.006369427,0,0,0.006369427,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0.025477707,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1592356687898089,0.082802548,0,0,0.025477707,0.082802548,0.044585987,0.01910828,0.012738854,0.006369427,0.089171975,0.006369427,0,0.038216561,0,0,0.070063694,0.031847134,0.1401273885350318,0.108280255

Like a compassionate mother, she nurtures every townsfolk, trader and tramp that takes to her lively banks. But understand this - she's as fickle as a coy maiden at a town dance too. Her roiling rage can bear down an almighty wrath on those who underestimate her. Indeed, life on the Mississippi, like life itself, oscillates between the gentle rocking of a cradle and the tumultuous turning of a typhoon.

A singular virtue in a society that scarcely valued intelligence in a woman over comeliness or affability. Hidden behind the facade of her ebony hair and deep-set, thoughtful hazel eyes, it lurked-- a bright, piercing sagacity. Unlike the other ladies who flaunted their charms at balls and country walks, Elizabeth wore her wit close to her heart, revealing glimpses of it only to the discerning observer. Repartee is a dance, she thought, in which neither the loudest nor the most charming necessarily holds sway, but rather he who understands timing, tempo, and truth.

20,93184,6,"Mrs. Hester, in her delicate mohair shawl and silk bonnet, set her cup of tea upon the fine lace doily with a sigh that spoke of both satisfaction and regret. She looked out the window, where cobblestone streets lay quiet under a veil of indigo dusk. Her heart fluttered like a robin caught in an early frost. Yes, she was warm and secure within her cozy parlor, surrounded by familiar veneered furniture that glistened in the dancing firelight; whereas out there, the harsh realities must be borne by poor souls bundled in threadbare coats.

A small boy, no more than seven years of age, struggling to place a hefty fishing pole between his tiny hands. His cheeks, flushed with the stubbornness of youth, and his brow, creased with unwavering determination. ""Young man,"" said I, ""fishing is a game of patience, not brute strength."" He whipped his head, took one long, hard look at me and retorted, ""Sir, the river don't care much for patience, it's the keeping on that gets the fish."" His unadulterated wisdom hit me like a cannonball - ain't that the truth of life? The river of time doesn't require our patience, but our resilience to keep on, come whatever might, that helps us catch our dreams.

Some folks, content to bob along in the comfortable backwaters of complacency, shy away from the tempestuous torrents that promise tribulation. Others, bold and thirsty for the unpredictable marrow of existence, plunge headfirst into the tumult, as compelled by the allure of fortune as they are bewitched by the specter of disaster. My advice, if one should be so inclined to heed it: cultivate a navigational philosophy 'twixt these two extremes.

She looked down at her hands, at the white gloves that adorned them, a symbol of her newfound adulthood. She pondered over the significance of the occasion, how the night's events would perhaps forever alter the trajectory of her life. Would she prove herself to be as stately and composed as her mother, the esteemed Lady Waverly, had always been? Or, she fretted, would she falter in her debut, establishing herself as a social pariah in the genteel society of Bellingham?

There's tranquil pools of joy in between, where we find our moment's peace. It's easy to get all flustered, wrestling with the rapids, and miss those quiet, sunny spots; but the wise man, he knows the value of savoring those pauses, of drawing strength from the stillness.

You'd think the dawn were some long-lost lover of his, the way he croons to her from the rooftop, stirring up somnolent souls from their precious slumbers. But it does put me right in the mind of progress, that cock-a-doodle doing. We're always barreling headlong into tomorrow, whether we're ready or not. No use attempting to linger in yesterday's shadows, because time, like that confounded rooster, swiftly hammers us onward into the brash and blinding light of the unexplored, like characters in a book yet to be written.

Nearby, a cicada choir commences their twilight symphony, each chirp a testament to lifeâ€™s unyielding rhythm. Just then, a faint breeze whispers through the cottonwoods, as if to hush any hint of mankind's nonsense and remind us that nature takes its course with or without our consent. Yes sir, in these quiet moments between daylight and darkness, life ain't nothing more than an old dusty book waiting to be readâ€”if only we'd have the mind to sit and turn the pages.

He was wont to sit in his well-lacquered rocking chair, the one that creaks so much you'd swear it was having a conversation with the floorboards, and puff on his corn cob pipe until the dusk painted the horizons in shades of whiskey. On long summer eves when the sun hung like a ripe peach over the fields, he'd regale any poor wanderer who listened with battle stories and tall tales of the river. His eyes, beady and sharp, would spark to life, as if each yarn he spun brought him one year closer to his younger, spryer self.

54,91134,4,"Had she solicited any counsel regarding the affairs of the heart, Miss Caroline Hastings would inevitably proclaim with great certainty that love is indeed a most inconvenient and vexatious intruder, prone to alighting upon the souls of men and women with wanton disregard for reason or propriety. Ah, the capricious currents of affection, she would sigh, quite undirected by the rules of sense, abuzz with impassioned fervor, which would not hesitate to upset the tranquil routines of a well-ordered existence! How maddeningly delightful and thoroughly disruptive it is, that the gentle stirrings of affection could concurrently fill a soul with such sweet torment and sublime joy! Most certainly, in the realm of romance, should one choose to partake, to journey the turbulent path of passion and pain, one must be prepared to relinquish some degree of control, to cede a portion of the reigns to that unsolicited invader named Love.

Not just any simple brook, mind you, but the mighty Mississippi, its swirling currents grabbing tight about your ankles, a-kicking you hither, thither, and yon, as it suits its own whimsical fancy. Sometimes it's a gentle journey, bobbing you atop its emerald depths in serene apathy, sundrenched and supine; other spells it's a tempestuous beast, a-roaring with the righteous fury of the heavens torn asunder. But whether silent and soft or raging and riled, you're sure to find no river that owns up to its course. No sir, youâ€™ll never step in the same stream twice, as old Heraclitus said.

He had a cantankerous disposition and a weathered face that bore the tale of his years on the river. Now, he was a peculiar sort of fellow, that's certain. As contrary as a catfish out of water, he held a deep loyalty to the river that was as strong and winding as the Mississippi herself. He'd say in his gravelly voice, ""Sonny, the river isn't just water and mud; it's a living, breathing entity, full of secrets and wisdom, if you've a mind to listen.""

He'd seen all manner of waterborne calamity, storm and calm, disaster and serenity, yet he insisted the river was not malicious, rather just misunderstood. ""She's got the temperament of an unbroken mustang, wild and free. Master her, and she'll carry you home. Disrespect her, and she'll buck you off faster than a rattlesnake strikes.""

62,90066,4,"Upon the crest of a lush hill, beneath the delicate rustling of a thousand emerald leaves, a quaint homestead crafted from sturdy New England oak stood sentinel. The demure home, quaint but dignified, belied the spirited vigor that lived within its walls. Inside, four young souls, wildly different in their convictions yet alike in their fervent adventurous spirit, stirred restlessly; the sisters March. Animated in their pursuit of wisdom and wit, they reveled in the current of unassuming joys life granted them. Perhaps they did not yet understand the lectern they themselves were becoming; to society, to womanhood, to those variegated tapestries of life they thread with their own hands. However, the wistful yet promising melody of their youthful days sang aloud one purpose - that their hearts were destined to etch a mark upon the world.

I beseech you, brethren, let us not be entangled in the superficialities of color. Deny, I urge, this impure social toxin, tilled by the hands of ignorance and hate. Power in unity, solace in understanding, and rectitude in justiceâ€”these are our vows of adhering to the cause of mankind's betterment. In the incandescent glow of such virtues, we shall not shirk; no colossal wave of bigotry can quench this beacon fiercer than Promethean fire, once its luminosity finds sanctum in every heart willing to bear it.

66,95635,4,"In the laziest corner of Missipahan, where the sun dawdles longest and the shadows draw their lengths like yawning cats, sprawled the one-horse town of Mudflap. It was as if God, in His infinite wisdom, had sketched the outlines of a town and then what with one thing and anotherâ€”diverted by a flood here, an uprising thereâ€”forgot to fill it in. Soupy mist crawled over wooden shanties and dirt roads, slow and unhurried as if time in these parts had not thought to pick up the pace over the years. A single church steeple punctuated the skyline, rusty and crooked as a poet's smile; a poor excuse for a beacon, yet it was the town's one nod towards civility, for Mudflap was home to scalawags and swindlers of the first water. Every soul was as ornery and stubborn as a mule, for even the river had to be coaxed and sweet-talked into flowing through it. And through it all, the town clung like a barnacle to the wide, windswept Mississippi seemingly unperturbed by the great river's spell of impermanence.

It ain't more than a fancy mirage, shimmering in the desert of our discontent, conjuring illusions mightier than reality.

Ah, but perhaps therein lies the very spice of existence: the humbling jigsaw of what we apprehend against what we pretend, naught but a frolicking dance twixt the grand pit of the known and the boundless theater of the unknown.""",synthetic,twain,Act like Mark Twain and write an original paragraph utilizing his style.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,29.25,0.9347636699676514,0,0,0.7876106194690266,0.5663716814159292,2.4609183673469386,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017699115,0,0,0.017699115,0,0,0,0.008849558,0.017699115,0,0,0.008849558,0.008849558,0,0,0.008849558,0,0,0,0.008849558,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008849558,0,0.008849558,0.008849558,0,0,0,0.008849558,0.079646018,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017699115,0,0,0.008849558,0,0.017699115,0,0.008849558,0,0,0.017699115,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.053097345,0,0,0,0.008849558,0,0,0.008849558,0.008849558,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008849558,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008849558,0,0,0,0.008849558,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044247788,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008849558,0,0.008849558,0,0,0,0,0.017699115,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.247787611,0.044247788,0,0,0.017699115,0.008849558,0.017699115,0.03539823,0.053097345,0.017699115,0.079646018,0,0,0.044247788,0,0,0.053097345,0.026548673,0.1592920353982301,0.1150442477876106

It's a coarse ditty strung upon the evening breeze. He bears little respect for harmony, our ferryman, and lays his hands upon his banjo as should one juggle porcelain vases - with clumsy determination. Yet somehow, through some wonder of providence or stubborn skill, he manages to evoke a tune nearly as enchanting as the lonesome cry of the whippoorwill. Yonder, lay bare the enduring paradox that is life, that such beauty can be woven from the same cloth of imperfections that gives rise to our sorrows.

She glanced back at the grand family manor, her childhood home. Once a haven of warmth and effusive laughter, its grand facade was now dulled by the relentless march of time and surrender to quiet emptiness. The hearth within had seldom seen a flame lately, and the robust roar of her father's voice was now just an echo in its silent halls. Life had hurled its hardships at the unsuspecting family, tearing away what was once abundant and replacing it with a persistent scarcity. Still, Amelia bore a strength within her, a flicker of hope that refused to be extinguished. She possessed the resolute spirit of the women in her familyâ€”with a love as deep as the blue sea, the capacity to endure all storms life might blow her way, and a well of wisdom that couldn't be learned, only inherited. And oh, wasn't she the most radiant sight, standing alone facing the merciless wind, eyes full of dreams, and a heart full of faith. Brave, like all the women before her, Amelia would rise and shine, come what may.

An enviable proposal of marriage had been extended to her by Mr. Charles Richardson, a gentleman of considerable wealth, consequence, and charm. Yet, his conspicuously refined charm and wealth, while appealing to many a young lady in their village of Hartfield, failed to entirely captivate Amelia's fancy. Indeed, she found herself inexplicably drawn towards his cousin, Mr. Thomas Rivers, a humble curate of great intellectual profundity, whose fortune and station might be deemed quite insignificant compared to the illustrious Mr. Richardson.

She was an unusual specimen amidst a society largely governed by strict custom and superficial proprieties. Elizabeth was not possessor of great fortune, nor was she a celebrated beauty, yet a curious charm enveloped her. It lay not in what she had, but rather in who she was - a woman of considerable candor and palpable verve. Unmarried at five and twenty, she had, by most societal standards, welcomed the title of 'spinster' a trifle early. Yet, her spirit remained undaunted, and her senses unseduced by the polished pretenses of her numerous suitors. Her heart desired a love that transcended the trappings of wealth and position, a sincere and enduring attachment.

76,95415,4,"On the peeling porch of a ramshackle old house that had seen the tentative glory of better days, old Roy sat hunched, his boots scuffed and his hat discolored by many a season. A corncob pipe hung from his weathered mouth while the whispering rhythms of the Mississippi danced in the vicinity. His eyes, half-hidden beneath a wrinkled brow, watched as the mischievous river lapped at the gnarled roots of cottonwood trees, that like Roy, had tenaciously held their ground for decades. The river was a capricious cheater, a roguish stealer of land, but Roy did not turn his back on it. It was part of their waltz, part of their lore.

Straying relentlessly from the path laid out for him by society and his truculent mother, he expressed little inclination towards matrimony, preferring instead to spend his days in tranquil solitude at his grand estate, Blackwood Manor, where he might indulge his love for literature and horseback riding without the interference of cumbersome social obligations. Yet, the inhabitants of the county, particularly the mothers of unmarried daughters, held ardent hope that a day would eventually dawn when Mr. Tillman would bid farewell to his bachelorhood and make a suitable match.

Notable too was her devoted affection.

Captain Brandon, the solemn and distinguished gentleman who had been so gallant of late, was to grace their hearth, obliging them with his preferred company for a quiet dinner. Her fevered spirit was torn - troubled by an anxiousness borne of hoping yet not hoping too much. She wished to appear pleasing to the good Captain's discerning eye, but dared not present herself as deliberately seeking his approval.

Rosalinda bore sorrows but also a resilience that promised hopes carried down from ancestral African lands, hopes that breathed life into the scriptures she'd come to learn and love. In her heart was a devotion to her people and a long simmering justice that began to churn with the heat of the early morning sun. The chill in the air was no match for her spirit, set aflame by whispers of rebellion. She, born free, was an imposition for those who leaned heavily on the sins of human captivity, but she stood tall, her gaze tethered to the unseen future.

Most folks walk around with their heads buried in the honking and herring of everyday prattle, not giving twopenny to the whispers of the wind in the willows, nor the soliloquy of the sun as it's laying its weary head below the horizon. There's a whole world of plain wonder and simple majesty out yonder just waiting for their eyes to stumble upon, should they ever lift their gaze from their shiny contrivances and bothersome bustle. But sometimes, just sometimes â€” mind you â€” a spectacle of nature, a pure piece of God's artwork, stings them right in the senses. And for that fleeting moment, they're amazed, gobsmacked at what they'd been blind to all those muddled and muddied years. All the gorgeous gimmickry of the world does nothing to match up to a dust-specked butterfly wing, a weather-worn rock or a humble creek hustling past pebbles. So, I says, there's always more than meets the eye, don't you see? If only folks would have the good sense to truly see.

There had been a persistent sameness in her existence that rendered her spirit agitated, her heart desiring an uncommon variety of life. She studied her familiar surroundingsâ€”the well-trodden path to the market, the old chestnut tree by the cemetery, her own modest countryside residenceâ€”with a sharpened and discerning eye, a critical sense of perception only valuable curiosity could induce. As she beheld her world anew, even the curated garden that she had lovingly tended appeared to her alarmingly common. Indeed, she found an urgent craving for excitementâ€”a craving for unusual happenings and uncommon affairsâ€”to be rather unceremonious in its arrival, seeping into the corners of her tranquil life. However, she bore no resentment towards this uninvited yearning; it was, she surmised, the grand call of adventure that her soul had long been silent to.

Now, Eli had a peculiar way about him â€“ he wore a continuous grin that squinted his azure eyes, and had a crick in his neck from an abundance of looking upwards. To Eli, the world was a grand play set before him, a kaleidoscope of life to be savored and cherished. He'd sail sticks down the rushing creeks, imagining them to be mighty steamboats; he'd crunch through autumn leaves, pretending they were the dense underbrush of some untouched wilderness.

112,95818,4,"Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher if life ain't one fascinating puzzle. You see, my dear friend, extending our grasp to understand such a dappled tapestry can oftentimes feel like trying to lasso the wind itself; impossible and expectant of a foolhardy ambition. Yet the beauty lies not in the understanding but in the pursuing, not unlike how a riverboat heeds the winding whims of the Mississippi. It keeps us humbly curious and rightly so. Now there's a notion fine as frog hair. We're just scraping the topsoil on the profound understanding of existence, and every day is another chance to dig a little deeper, to sift through the mire of life's mysteries with open hands and a welcoming heart. 

Remember, the essence of brilliance is often found stashed away in the fringes of absurdity. Life, in its grand scheme, is nothing but a farcical opera put together by the cosmic humorist. We are but temporary actors adding our personal nuances to the unfolding drama, full of sound and fury. So, don't you fret about understanding every bit of it; instead, take the joy in paddling hard and keeping your riverboat afloat.

As she idly cracked her sugar biscuit between her delicate fingers, she afforded more than a passing glance at the ornate clock sitting decorously atop the mantelpiece. Its second hand moved with lazy lassitude, appearing to share no sense of urgency with its observer. The anxious woman cast her gaze through the garlanded window, her heart fluttering against the prospect of seeing her favorite daughter, Jane, coupled with the amiable and well-moneyed gentleman. It was hard to say if it was the anticipation that punctuated every passing moment or merely her naturally excitable disposition that caused her to exclaim loudly, much to Mr. Bennettâ€™s amusement and Jane's mild embarrassment, ""Mr. Bennett, mark my words, Mr. Bingley shall make an excellent husband for our fair Jane.""",synthetic,austen,Write an original paragraph in the style of Jane Austen.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,31.6,-0.996475756,0,0.074324324,0.7162162162162162,0.581081081,2.583410852713178,0.013513514,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.013513514,0,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0.013513514,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0.013513514,0,0,0.006756757,0,0.006756757,0.054054054,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0,0.013513514,0,0.013513514,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.027027027,0,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.027027027,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0.02027027,0,0,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.027027027,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0,0.033783784,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0.006756757,0,0,0,0,0,0.2837837837837837,0.013513514,0,0,0.040540541,0.074324324,0.02027027,0.006756757,0.006756757,0,0.094594595,0.006756757,0,0.033783784,0,0,0.047297297,0.074324324,0.1283783783783783,0.094594595

She's tempestuous, downright untamable, balks at the very thought of a guiding hand. And yet, we, the ambitious lot we are, will insist on crafting some plan, forging some path in our minds, only to find ourselves on some unexpected tributary. You might argue it's labor in vain, this ceaseless desire to map the unchartable. But, oh, the sweet victory when a thing previously thought undiscoverable is found! It is in these intimate dances with failure and success that life's truest gems are uncovered. So fear not the river's power, nor its might. It is in these high waters we find our true selves.

There were two men, one had an abundance of gold and the other an abundance of wit. Yet it oftentimes seemed the universe has a peculiar sense of humor, for the man rich in gold was starved of wit whilst the man rich in wit was sorely deprived of gold. Was it not cruelly ironic, they often pondered, that the very thing one had in excess was the other's lacking? The rich man would hoard his gold, the witty man would spin his tales, and both would lie in bed at night wishing for a bit of what the other possessed.

118,95543,3,"In the heat of a Mississippi midsummer, I chanced upon a dilapidated shack nestled against the curve of the river, shrouded in willows that rustled whisper-soft secrets on the sultry breeze. This old hut, more timber and nails than house, had seen better days, clearly touched by the relentless fingers of time and the ceaseless pranks of river serpents - be they the squirming ones that lurk unseen in the murky depths, or the two-legged kind, dapperly dressed in the guise of gentlemen, hustling every God-fearing soul they encounter for all they're worth. From beneath the weather-beaten porch, a hound dog, ancient as the house itself and twice as spectral, opened one rheumy eye to inspect me before letting out a noise somewhere between a moan and a sigh, deciding, as it seemed, that I presented little threat or sausage, and sliding back into the realm of dreams from whence it had shortly, and with some reluctance, been evoked.",synthetic,twain,Write an original paragraph in the style of Mark Twain.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,53,0.297720343,0,0,0.7207792207792207,0.5454545454545454,2.541,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038961039,0,0.006493506,0,0.012987013,0,0,0,0.038961039,0,0.006493506,0.006493506,0,0.006493506,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.019480519,0,0,0,0.012987013,0,0,0,0.006493506,0.019480519,0,0,0.006493506,0,0.019480519,0.084415584,0,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0,0.025974026,0,0,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0.006493506,0.012987013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038961039,0,0,0,0,0,0.006493506,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012987013,0,0.006493506,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0.012987013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006493506,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2142857142857142,0.071428571,0,0,0.012987013,0.051948052,0.025974026,0.038961039,0.019480519,0,0.058441558,0,0,0.038961039,0.012987013,0,0.045454545,0,0.1753246753246753,0.1493506493506493
119,95511,3,"Indeed, the grandeur of the Mississippi River never fails to astound, even to the humblest of onlooker. Itâ€™s a river that knows its dominance, rushing forward with the insistence of time itself; carrying tales and dreams from territories far off, where the sun paints crimson horizons and the stars don their glittering cloaks. Such a persistent river could tell you a tale if you had the patience to listen; a tale of brave souls, adventurous spirits, and love fleeting as a river-breeze. It was upon these formidable banks that our protagonist found himself, squinting into the setting sun, musing whether his fate would match the unabashed vigor of the river, or be as transient as its foamy waves, vanishing amidst the vastness of its desolate heart.

120,91003,3,"Upon his most sacred honor, Mr. Fitzwilliams found himself subject to a most singular vexation. Ensconced within the warm confines of his stately study, he perused, with a bedeviled countenance, the vehemently worded letter from Lady Matilda. There, beneath the stately glow of the evening lamp, his heart paced with an unsettled rhythm. This missive bore such urgent insistence of a reply, piqueing as it did on matters poignant and delicate. The lady had been unduly affronted by his tardiness to their last soiree, a failing on his part evoked by manifold attenuating matters. But of course, the gentlewoman would not have it; women of her standing were habituated to fishwives' patience. Amidst the hustle of society's trite trivialities, poor Mr. Fitzwilliams rued his predicament- a gallant gentleman must always, he was starkly reminded, pay heed to the demands of social propriety.

She's the main artery running through the heartland, pulsating with a rhythm older than time itself. Each ripple on her surface echoes stories of battles fought, and lives lived. She's not just a river; she's a constant companion to those in her embrace. Now, ain't that a thing as wonderful as a cat with two tails! Back in my day, we wouldn't spend our time jabbering on about such trivial matters as profit, or time, or whatnot. No sir! Our eyes would be glued to the Mississippi, marveling at that grand river's quiet majesty and incessant whispering of stories. It's a different time now, but that lady river, I reckon, remains the same as ever she was. Oh, the tales I could tell, yet they'd pale in comparison to the ones she holds.

A familiar scene, indeed, but today, it seemed as though the world around him had been blighted by an unwelcome filter. The joyous laughter erupting from the group of young children playing on the outskirts of the town square sounded shrill to his ears. The cobblestone pathways beneath his feet, once so solid and reliable, had an unsettling softness to them. Everything was changed, and yet, everything was the same. As Josiah delved into his own thoughts, he realized, it wasn't the town that had altered, but his perceptions. Men of cloth, he mused, are not exempt from the trials and tribulations of life, and it was in this moment of desolation, that his faith, like a phoenix, was destined to rise, more resilient and more powerful.",synthetic,griggs,Write an original paragraph in the style of Sutton Griggs.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,22.285714285714285,0.2618121206760406,0.058064516,0,0.6774193548387096,0.5870967741935483,2.460378787878788,0.006451613,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012903226,0,0,0.012903226,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038709677,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006451613,0.019354839,0,0,0,0.006451613,0.012903226,0.006451613,0,0,0,0.019354839,0.077419355,0.006451613,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0.012903226,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0.032258065,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0.019354839,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.019354839,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0,0,0,0.032258065,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012903226,0,0,0,0,0.019354839,0,0,0.006451613,0,0.006451613,0,0,0.006451613,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1806451612903225,0.077419355,0,0,0.006451613,0.1032258064516129,0.025806452,0.032258065,0.006451613,0.006451613,0.096774194,0,0,0.038709677,0.012903226,0,0.04516129,0.04516129,0.1354838709677419,0.1096774193548387

She yearned for papers filled with ink, words woven like stories of old, to dive into tales and histories that sprawled across millennia. She was drawn, like an iron shard to a magnet, to the miracles of education. But alas, sable Adelia, encased within societal limitations thicker than fortified bastions, was shrouded in expectation to be less than what her heart aspired to be.

130,95948,3,"In the sprawling lushness of this Mississippi morn, where the sun yet struggles to assert dominion over the lingering fog, the river whispers to those few who care to listen. It murmurs of its tireless odyssey, of all things it has seen, from the lofty howl of the wolf to the meek rustlings of the autumn leaves. It is a storyteller, the river, and its tales are as steady and enduring as its inexorable flow.

Its peaked gables were black arches against the midnight heavens, and the ivy, like a creeping phantom, was imprinted with the spectral glow of a slim moon. He felt an uncanny chill, as if the Manor itself stared back at him with ghostly, vacant windows. His heart clutched at him, the clammy hand of fear squeezing it tightly within his chest. On such a night as this, all nature seemed brooding under some malediction. And under these cold and glimmering stars, the shadow of death fell as completely over Edward as the shadow of the Manor itself.

In their rustic grandeur, they're like a looking-glass to the past, a stark reminder of simpler times brimming with complicated folk.

Yes, Professor, there sits a universe in every man's soul just as sure as there's a catfish in the river, and just as elusive when you try to grab onto 'em. The folly of man is often this: he seeks himself in the minds of others, bouncing from person to person like a wayward pinball, when all he ought to do is sit quiet-like, as on a log in the twilight, and listen to the subtle stirrings of his own spirit. Pity the poor fool who casts his net in shallow marsh, whilst pearls of wisdom lay nestled deep within his very self, waiting but for a quiet moment of introspection to unveil their luminescent glow.

His parents, respectable and hardworking townsfolk, had resigned to his whims and fancies, their brows furrowed with a simmering worry that was etched into their work-worn faces. The townsfolk often shook their heads when Billy Ray passed, his pockets filled with frogs and his laugh carried on the winds of whimsy that blew through Spoonbill.

151,95696,3,"At the muddy bend of the Mississippi River, where the frogs croaked hymns of forgotten wisdom and willows wept in the summer heat, there planted itself a little town by the name of Copperfield. It weren't much to speak of, true, but to its inhabitants, it was the whole world and heaven in between. Folks born and raised in Copperfield had a peculiar skill for chatter; it was their stock in trade. They'd swap stories over a jug of sky-fire whiskey as readily as they'd trade cotton or corn. And in this town, there resided a boy, not older than ten, known to everyone as Rascal Jim - a name, I assure you, he earned through deeds as numerous as the stars, each one more scandalous than the last.

158,95682,2,"That afternoon, as the sun began to dip below the thick hem of the forest, casting long burnt-orange streaks over the mighty Mississippi, young Johnny Cutter set his sights on the bustling town of Hannibal. Johnny was a rakish boy of twelve, with mischievous glints in his eyes and a near-perpetual smear of dirt adorning his freckled face.

It's quite the peculiar show, filled with characters of all stripes: scoundrels who parade around in lamplight, pretending to be knights, and well-wishers who can't lift a finger during a fiasco but sure have their hands full when prosperity makes her drowsy wink. This beautiful, often hapless swirl we call life seems to be somewhat masterminded by that insatiable prankster of an author: Fate. Did you ever consider that, in the colossal pageant of existence, we're not much more than ants on a log, floating on the whims of a stream, shouting our anthems, our cries of war and our lullabies to an audience of fireflies and frogs, who, much to our chagrin, pay us no mind what-so-ever!

160,91096,2,"It was somewhat after two under the azure canopy of the heavens when Miss Amelia Sutherland, with an air of perseverance and agency of grace, embarked upon her solitary expedition towards the secluded gardens. Her gown of satin, showing the most delicate shade imperative of the morning bloom, danced lightly as she moved with a countenance that reflected a tender balance of consternation and anticipation. Her eyes, spirited and bright, darted across the vast complexity of verdant growth and colourful array. This particular pursuit was not one of vanity or of frivolous pleasure, rather, it was a rendezvous of vested emotional importance, for her heart had long been occupied by a certain gentleman, Mr. Frederick Allendale, who had, in the most recent of correspondences, demanded her affections in a manner so earnest that she deemed it impossible to disregard. However, she knew not what fruit their conversation would bear, for the uncertainty of love was the only certainty she presently held. Nonetheless, she ventured on, for courage, she had realized, is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.

Yes, here, in this pocket of the world, surviving on kindness and little else, lived the richest souls youâ€™d ever hope to meet. Compare them to the rest of mankind, and you'd count yourself lucky for such wealth could never be tallied with coins and banknotes, but with the heartbeats that race in joy, in sorrow, in love, and every precious breath drawn under Godâ€™s blue sky.

168,93379,2,"In a particular quarter of the town of Mellington, where red-brick houses fought for prominence against the encroaching vine-encrusted cottages, there resided the taciturn Mrs. Pritchard. Widowed, but far from submissive, she wore her widow's weeds with a regal austerity that even the village's lofty aristocrats might envy. Her house, quaint and decorous, stood in a cluster of evenly spread Elms, casting defiant shadows that lulled the pavement into an eternal twilight, all of it giving off an air of collected solitude. Mrs. Pritchardâ€™s mornings commenced with the precise rhythm of a clockmakerâ€™s timepiece, set in its ways like the old cobbles that graced the narrow streets around. As such, the entirety of Mellington would have been startled, to put it mildly, if they were aware of the disarray that was to descend upon Mrs. Pritchardâ€™s predictable universe this particularly unassuming Tuesday morning.

The path before us is fraught with uncertainty, the future is hazy with clouds of doubt, yet as long as we bear the legacy of our forbears, no darkness can populate our spirits; no, we shall remain defiant light radiating the promise of our heritage, steadfast in our quest for justice, equality, and dignity for all.",synthetic,hopkins,Act like Pauline Hopkins and write an original paragraph utilizing her style.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,29.83333333333333,0.9984383583068848,0,0,0.6815642458100558,0.5586592178770949,2.334967741935484,0,0,0,0,0,0.011173184,0,0,0,0.011173184,0,0,0.005586592,0,0.005586592,0,0,0.044692737,0,0,0.039106145,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.005586592,0.005586592,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.005586592,0,0.005586592,0.005586592,0.011173184,0,0,0,0,0.011173184,0.05027933,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.022346369,0,0,0,0,0.016759777,0,0,0.005586592,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.011173184,0.022346369,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05027933,0,0,0.011173184,0,0,0.005586592,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.016759777,0,0.005586592,0,0,0,0.005586592,0,0,0,0,0.011173184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.027932961,0,0,0,0,0,0.027932961,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.005586592,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.005586592,0,0,0,0.005586592,0,0,0,0,0.1787709497206704,0.1117318435754189,0,0,0.033519553,0.022346369,0.022346369,0.016759777,0.022346369,0.016759777,0.072625698,0,0,0.061452514,0,0,0.05027933,0.078212291,0.1564245810055866,0.072625698

She was not blessed with a great fortune, nor with physical beauty that would have made her the cynosure of all gatherings, but she possessed an intelligent mind and a heart filled generously with warmth and compassion. Each day, she would make her way to the local lending library, carefully selecting novels that offered a respite from the monotony of village life. In the comfort of her own quaint sitting room, she would find herself lost in the exploits of indomitable heroines and the grand affairs of dashing gentlemen, their plights and triumphs mirroring her own battles in the unassuming life she led.

I still recollect, with a certain youthful mirth, how this vaporous vandal would obscure the river's course, making it seem as though the world ended just at the prow of our modestly ramshackle riverboat. The steam whistle would let out a robust, mournful melody, as if serenading the unseen spectres obscured by the fog banks. The river, the boat, the crew, and I, all together seemed trapped in a bewitching fog-drowned portrait painted by that grandest impractical jokester of them all, Mother Nature.

172,95851,2,"Well, now, let me tell you a tale that might tickle the ribs of your imagination. Down by the Mississippi struts a young lad, freckled face kissed by the simmering sun, eyes sparklin' with an appetite for adventure that could shame the boldest of explorers. His trousers, more patches than original cloth, are a testament to the mischief that follows him like a faithful hound dog.

A hound, ragged and grizzled, was engaged in a rousing debate with his own tail, chasing it in tireless circles while letting loose a chorus of baffled barks. Now, this sight did startle me, for I do declare it was the first time I had witnessed such heated discourse without a shred of sense, save for those fiery meetings held in Washington. I contemplated therewith, how the hound and politician ain't too dissimilar - one chases his tail out of instinct, the other one does it out of obstinate pride; yet, they both make a grand fuss, and neither gets anywhere fruitful.

The afternoon light made molasses of the river - thick and heavy, yet sweet to the eye. Little Jimmy Baxter was squattin' down by the river's edge, hand dangling a string into that brown water, all full of dreams about catching old Catfish Joe. His dog, Rufus, was by his side, equally invested in this venture, expectant eyes fixed on the turbid water. A peeping blue jay sat up in the part-leafed cottonwood, crooning about matters only blue jays understand. Time itself seemed to slow down on such a day, as relaxed as a lazy old mule sprawled out in a field of clover, waiting for nothing in particular to happen.

His journey was nowhere simple, paved as it was with ingenious hardships and implausible victories, demanded of him by the unforgiving crucible of his existence. The determination in his eyes reflected the silent resilience of his spirit, a spirit sharpened on taunting adversities. He had dreams of ascending, dreams that breathed in him purpose, and kindled the flame of ambition in the core of his being.

His flame-red hair was as unruly as his spirit and he had an uncanny knack for magnetizing trouble of the most absurd sort. There he was, sporting a blue-and-white striped jumper that had seen better days and grinning like he had just swindled the devil out of a jackpot at the poker table, insinuating a story, an adventure, or â€“ the Lord help us â€“ a calamity stirring in the brewing betwixt those freckled ears.

207,91697,2,"In the soft whispered cooing of twilight, beneath the elongated shadow of the ancient elm, there sat a sole figure, unusually still. Her name, Miss Eliza Howard, bore the tonality of a riddle not yet solved. As elusive as the moon on a mist filled night, she carried within her the multitude of emotions that danced like flickering candles behind her eyes; a prism of joy, sorrow and unspoken dreams. Modest in her attire, seemingly receding, blending in the background, she might be easily overlooked by the impetuous or the incautious.

She held in her hands a delicate paisley fan, absentmindedly fanning herself as she pondered the events of the afternoon. Never before had her heart been thusly troubled â€” a veritable tempest in the usually placid sea of her emotions. The elegance of the room and the gentle humming of a bumblebee against a window pane provided but scant comfort. The unexpected arrival â€” nay, the precipitous intrusion â€” of Mr. Rupert Alsop into the sanctity of her world had indeed created such a tumult that no amount of reading on patience and stoicism could have prepared her for.

214,92795,1,"In the quaint township of Millcote Shire, where the streets paraded sepia-toned cobblestones and the chimneys danced with sporadic gusts of smoky delight, lived our protagonist, Barnaby Puckle, an unassuming haberdasher of dubious fortunes. From the early dawn, his diligent fingers were kept fervently busy, mending and threading the various fabrics of his trade - the velvets, brocades, and damasks, each with their own fables woven into them - as the feeble rays of Mr. Sun peered spectacles-first through the smudged glass of his narrow shop. Puckle, stout and sprightly, donned a perpetual countenance of being almost startled to be alive, his eyes astoundingly wide for a man who had witnessed forty two winters, and a top hat perched defiantly on his balding pate, as if to make amends for his waning hairline. â€œI may be balding, but never boring,â€ Puckle would often declare, to anyone who would listen, and to many who wouldn't.

221,95490,1,"Upon a muddled morning, alongside the mighty Mississippi, young Jasper sat himself down and began his day with an unusual air of discontent. Never was there a boy so drawn to the river's roaring whimsy; the wooden rafts, the wayward fishermen, the humble steamboats thump-thump-thumping down the current. But today, he saw them all in a different light. His gaze wasn't attracted by the methodical swells and retreats of the water, but seemed instead to be drawn to an elusive something, musing far beyond the misty horizon. The river, for its part, was as unchanging as it was enthralling, seeming to echo the wisdom of the ages, as if to say, ""Life ain't nothing more than a fleetin' moment between two eternities; make the most of the rushing currents, son, before they carry ye on past this here bend."" That morning, the mighty Mississippi unraveled wisdom as only ol' rivers do, and young Jasper began to perceive the broader strokes of life's masterpiece.

222,93538,1,"To the modern traveller, the Yorkshire moors may seem a barren and desolate place, where the wind howls as if possessed by a restless spirit and the heather, purpling under the capricious skies, grows wild and unruly. Yet, if one possesses the temerity to stray from the well-trodden path, to brave the undulating moorland and seek secrets whispered by the wind, there transpires a strange enchantment about it, as wild and mysterious as the tales spun by the village folk by crackling hearth fires. Squint your eyes in the fading twilight, dear reader, and perhaps you may glimpse the fleeting figure of an ancient specter or a wayward maiden, her silhouette etched against the moonlit canvass, a tragic testimony to a bygone and forgotten era.

228,93746,1,"In the heart-gripping turbulence of the reformed South, sat Samson, a former bondsman, who stared wide-eyed at the boundless crib of opportunity that lay before him. Embroidered by a horde of dreams, he had found his hard-earned freedom, yet freedom it was, which bore the weight of an insurmountable challenge; it draped over him like a mantle heavy with responsibility. He wasn't a mere silhouette in the shadows any longer; he was a free man bathed in the golden light of liberty, yet incapable of shedding the grievous remains of a haunting past. The bitter tang of shackles he had once felt around his wrists now materialized into ethereal boundaries that seemed to separate him from the world of those who had been born free. As he sat there, lost in the contemplation of the profound paradox of his liberation, he knew that although the fetters of enslavement had fallen away, the struggle for true recognition was far from over.",synthetic,griggs,Write an original paragraph in the style of Sutton Griggs.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,32.2,0.9878368973731996,0.076433121,0,0.643312102,0.5222929936305732,2.3464084507042253,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038216561,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025477707,0,0,0,0.006369427,0.01910828,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0.082802548,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025477707,0,0,0.006369427,0,0.006369427,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012738854,0.006369427,0,0.006369427,0,0,0.076433121,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012738854,0,0.006369427,0.012738854,0,0,0,0,0.012738854,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0.006369427,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0.025477707,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0.006369427,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1656050955414012,0.038216561,0,0,0.006369427,0.1019108280254777,0.006369427,0.063694268,0,0,0.095541401,0,0,0.044585987,0,0,0.070063694,0.01910828,0.2038216560509554,0.1401273885350318
229,95796,1,"As the sun began its slow descent over the mighty Mississippi, young Huckleberry Thorne set afoot his ramshackle raft with a spirit full of wonderment, his eyes every bit as wide as the river itself. A motley assembly of dogs, chickens, and one decidedly indignant pig let out a cacophony of protests at the perturbation of their peaceful reverie, but none of this seemed to make any difference to Huck. He cast a quick glance at the remnants of St. Louis, the city lights flickering like playful fireflies in the hazy midsummer dusk; civilization, as he had come to understand it, was something to be left behind. With a heart full of resolve and a canvas sack of provisions borrowed with no exact intention to return, he pushed off from the riverbank. His journey wasn't to any particular destination - no, to Huck Thorne it was the journey itself that held the allure; the freedom to live by his own rules, to traverse the endless hay-colored fields and deep tranquil blues of the all-encompassing river, to simply be.

A pall of dread seemed to blanketed the hills and hollows like a spectral fog. The solitude of my existence shrieked with greater desolation upon sight of this fortress of stone. The house, unfeeling and unwelcoming, was like time itself, stolidly standing against the world's onslaught, unyielding to its fate, bearing the burdens and secrets of generations past and present within its cold walls.

The wind was subtly playing around, teasing the delicate white blanket on the trees that stood so tall and nourished, reflecting the integrity she herself yearned to embody. Besides the crackling fireplace, her mother sat, deeply engrossed in her stitching, her creased hands moving diligently as though they wove not just wool, but a warm cocoon of love and security that enshrouded them through these long and icy nights. Yet, within Hermione awakened a longing as the year drew to a close, a wish for the fair touch of spring, the freshness of adventures yet to be embarked upon, the tendrils of youthful dreams that yearned for blossoming.

The handsome Captain Wilkins, with his hazel eyes aglow and well-cut attire, had left an imprint upon her heart that couldn't be disregarded. It was not just his commanding presence, nor his eloquent discourse, but his genuine devotion to the less fortunate that stirred her affections. Yet, she fretted over the impending dinner tonight at Pemberley, for it would certainly put her sentiments to the test. Thus lost in contemplation, as the amber light danced upon the aged parchment of her beloved bound volumes, Miss Bennett herself bore an air of Jane Austen's revered heroines, holding fast to good sense amidst the chaos of ardent emotions.

On such nights, where soul-clinging shadow weaves itself so tightly into the fabric of reality, unseen terrors assumed their rightful, dread-filled dominion.

Raised under the spectral shadow of an unfulfilled emancipation, Meredith bore his lineage not as a shackle but as a dutiful reminder of resilience. As a beacon proclaiming that the denser the darkness, the brighter and mightier shall be the luminescence that undoes it. It were as if his melanin-infused skin had been chosen to reflect the newfound ebullience in his heart, to defrag the complexity of his existence into one singular cause - to prove that his race, as beleaguered as they might be, held the power within them to rise above the blight and caste, like the mighty Phoenix, their destinies anew from the smoldering ashes of the past.",synthetic,griggs,Act like Sutton Griggs and write an original paragraph utilizing his style.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,33.4,0.9936506152153016,0.042424242,0,0.6666666666666666,0.509090909,2.328873239,0.006060606,0,0,0,0,0.012121212,0,0,0,0.006060606,0,0,0.024242424,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012121212,0,0,0,0.006060606,0.012121212,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006060606,0,0,0,0.006060606,0.006060606,0,0,0.006060606,0.024242424,0,0,0,0,0.048484848,0.109090909,0.006060606,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018181818,0,0,0.006060606,0.006060606,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006060606,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006060606,0.036363636,0.006060606,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006060606,0,0.012121212,0,0,0,0,0,0.018181818,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006060606,0,0,0,0,0.006060606,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03030303,0,0,0,0.012121212,0,0,0.006060606,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2303030303030303,0.042424242,0,0,0.042424242,0.048484848,0.024242424,0.03030303,0.012121212,0.006060606,0.048484848,0.006060606,0,0.018181818,0,0,0.036363636,0.048484848,0.1757575757575757,0.1393939393939394

Her manner was one of distinguished, yet down-to-earth grace, a quality striking to each visiting tradesman and townsperson, but most evident in the tender care she exercised over her roses.

239,91029,1,"It was an early morning at Marston Manor, when Mr. Eversley, most esteemed for his noble lineage and agreeable manners, ventured out for a solitary walk. Most singularly, the early sunlight sparkled over the dew-kissed roses and violets in the garden, casting a heavenly hue over his ruminations. Strolling with earnest purpose, he deliberated upon the amiable Miss Charlotte's witty repartee of the evening prior. Her fine eyes, as bright as the morning star, and her wit, sharp as the winterâ€™s chill, filled his mind and animated his heart. It was her artless simplicity, patience and unaffected insights that not only beguiled him but made him innovate about love â€“ a silent sentiment that was previously moderated by the stately decorum of his station. He found himself on the brink of an uncharted emotion, one that whispered sweet sonnets of surrender, an emotion one ought to call - affection. Yet within this dawning realm of sentimentality, Mr. Eversley stood, oscillating between unguarded expression or customary restraint; a condition most peculiar, for he, till then, had known heart's command to follow only that of duty and decorum.

I recollect those carefree days on the paddle wheel, both manic and dull, frenzied and slow, consistently unpredictable in its firm predictability. The river, in her wonky wisdom, is a sight like no other, shimmering with secrets, alive with both promise and change, yet remaining as constant and dependable as any companion man's ever had. Indeed 'tis a world within a world, rife with lore for the lad keen on the thrill of discovery and the satisfaction of story yet unwritten. Any soul willing to navigate her fickle bends and twirls, shall find gifts aplenty and wisdom that stays a lifetime.

He was, by birth, a Negro man in an era that strived vehemently to fetter his kind in the unsparing chains of inequity. His skin bore the color of the darkest ebony, a hue the world had chosen to begrudge. Yet, he harbored fervent dreams, dreams that dared to pierce the borders of his society's harshly drawn lines. The night air played gently upon his brow as he lifted his eyes to the heavens, stars sparkling like an echoing refrain of unforgivable beauty. Their light seemed to serve as a beacon, a hallowed emblem of potential transcending the omnipresent flames of societal furiousness that sought to scorch his dreams. To him, their brilliance reflected an essential truth; the human spirit, however suppressed it might be, can't help but strive for its deserved victories. And so, he resolved, with renewed vigor, to rise as a luminary amongst those stars. His craving for knowledge and emancipation soaring beyond the bounds of his humble origins, undeterred by the scornful gazes, unjust systemic forces, or the lingering threats under starless skies, his unwavering stride echoed the thundering pulse of his innate resilience and the spirit of an indomitable race.",synthetic,griggs,Write an original paragraph in the style of Sutton Griggs.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,23.666666666666668,0.9957045912742616,0.08056872,0,0.6729857819905213,0.5592417061611374,2.3919337016574587,0.004739336,0,0,0,0,0.004739336,0,0,0,0.004739336,0,0,0.023696682,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014218009,0,0,0,0.004739336,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.004739336,0,0,0,0,0.014218009,0,0,0,0,0.014218009,0.075829384,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014218009,0,0,0.018957346,0,0.009478673,0,0,0,0.004739336,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.052132701,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.009478673,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.004739336,0,0,0,0,0,0.004739336,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.004739336,0,0,0,0.009478673,0.004739336,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037914692,0,0,0.004739336,0.004739336,0,0,0,0.009478673,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1800947867298578,0.085308057,0,0,0.042654028,0.066350711,0.033175355,0.023696682,0.004739336,0.004739336,0.08056872,0,0.004739336,0.033175355,0,0,0.028436019,0.071090047,0.1327014218009478,0.1232227488151658
242,92266,1,"In the deepest recesses of consciousness, secrets lie veiled, waiting for an opportune moment when they might unmask their hideous heads and claw their truths into the very soul of their keeper. Such a moment was upon John, as he found himself seated in the warm glow of the sunset, the world around him aglow with gold and amber, as if the heavens themselves held the sun captive at the horizon. John, a man cast in a mold of hardship and a heart hardened by the harsh brush of life, found it ironic that within such radiant beauty lay his darkest hour.

Indeed, it seemed the sun, in its final hours of resplendence, sought to illuminate the very corridors of his tormented soul.

The very same chap who appears all high and mighty at the Sunday sermon, spouting scriptural wisdom like an eager fountain, might be found deep in his cups come Monday's eve, crooning old sailor songs with the local riff-raff under the dim glow of the saloon's errant lantern, a scene ripe with the scent of sin and cheap whiskey. Well, it ain't for us to judge the ways and whims and fancies of folks. Life's but a grand old stage, and we're all clambering about, trying to remember our lines, and wouldn't it be a sorry spectacle if we all recited them just so, without a miss, without a hint of off-the-cuff improvisation, boldly flouting the script that divine author above had first penned?

Yet, every so often, it will surprise you with a moment of pure joy, a moment that's as rare and precious as a baby's first giggle or seeing a riverboat round the bend after being stranded on that vast riverbank of lonesomeness. So, hold onto your hope and your wits, weather your indignities with a spirit as unbreakable as fine China, and live each day like the captain of your unique ship, sailing on a vast sea of promise and challenge.

She was of a respectable age, neither too young to be considered naive nor too old to be disregarded, but in the prime of her life whose radiance was amplified by her intellect rather than her physical bloom. Bestowed with fortune not ample enough to arouse envy, nor meager enough to invoke pity, she had been quite at ease with her circumstances. Alas, as of late, she found herself under the merciless clutches of unaccounted disquiet, for her solitude, hitherto a chamber of peace, had become a cauldron of relentless introspection, and the quiet ticking of the grandfather clock in her drawing room had grown louder, an audible reminder of her stagnant circumstances in the ceaseless flow of time.",synthetic,austen,Write a paragraph from an original novel in the style of Jane Austen.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,36,0.978217065,0,0.090909091,0.6853146853146853,0.5804195804195804,2.273461538461538,0,0,0,0,0,0.013986014,0,0,0,0.006993007,0,0,0.020979021,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.020979021,0,0,0,0.006993007,0,0,0.013986014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.020979021,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006993007,0,0.006993007,0.048951049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.027972028,0,0,0.006993007,0,0.013986014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006993007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06993007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006993007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.013986014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006993007,0.006993007,0,0,0,0,0,0.013986014,0,0.013986014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.027972028,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2377622377622377,0.027972028,0,0,0.027972028,0.055944056,0,0.048951049,0.006993007,0,0.1258741258741259,0,0,0.041958042,0.006993007,0,0.027972028,0.062937063,0.1678321678321678,0.076923077

Samuel, now masquerading as a rough-spun river rat named Sam, was perched high atop a rickety barrel, busy whittlin' down a piece of sycamore, endeavored to recreate the likeness of his dear Mama's countenance before the smallpox had stolen her away. Sweat dribbled, hotter'n a teapot on the boil, down his sunburnt cheeks, slipping down his neck to be soaked up by the grubby kerchief round his throat. On such a scorching day, even the river seemed to move slower, like it was struggling through molasses, mirroring the indolent spirit suspended in the softheatin' air. Samâ€™s sharp eyes took in the placid, sloppy roll of the grand ol' Mississippi, nearly as well-known to him as the barren dirt roads of a home town he was driven from by nothing more than the burning ambition of a boy who wasnâ€™t yet ready to become a man. But, oh, ain't it a truth that life sinks its teeth in the rump of your hindside when you least expect it? Yep, that's right.

His azure eyes held the depth of a thousand untold tales, lighting up with mischief at the prospect of a new adventure. Each day the sun rose was another day for him to argue with the wind, chase the squirrels, and argue about who ruled the roost; the Kingfisher or the Muddy Mississippi.

But something tugged at his conscience that day, a sort of restless whisper carried by the wind, and to ignore it seemed a sin akin to stealing away the night's only star.",synthetic,twain,Write a paragraph from an original novel in the style of Mark Twain.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,35,-0.972828686,0.02962963,0,0.7185185185185186,0.5703703703703704,2.5002419354838707,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0.037037037,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014814815,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0.022222222,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0.088888889,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014814815,0,0,0.007407407,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0.014814815,0,0,0,0,0,0.066666667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0,0.007407407,0.007407407,0,0.007407407,0.007407407,0,0.007407407,0.014814815,0,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0.037037037,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0.007407407,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2592592592592592,0.037037037,0,0,0.022222222,0.059259259,0.044444444,0.02962963,0,0,0.044444444,0.007407407,0,0.066666667,0,0,0.022222222,0.02962963,0.1629629629629629,0.1481481481481481

278,90788,1,"Upon such an evening did Mr. Bingley return from his daily pursuits, his countenance marked by an uncharacteristic seriousness that aroused the attention of his dear sister, Caroline, fervent as she was in her attentions to her brother's disposition. Well-acquainted with his habitual joviality, he found in his grim aspect ample cause for concern. Lighting the sitting room with the soft glow of the hearth fire, Caroline sat aside, her needlework neglected on her lap as she studied him with an equal measure of curiosity and anxiety. He exhibited a degree of introspection seldom seen before and which, in her conjecture, was not without a connection to his frequent exchanges with Ms. Bennet, a lady of their acquaintance whose charms were undeniable but whose social standing, she could hardly deny, left much to be desired.

He lived just past the old mill, in a tumbledown shack that seemed to be one gust away from toppling over into the Tallahatchie. But you know, it never did, though God knows, the Mississippi winds sure tried. Jeremiah was the kind to sit on the porch come rain or shine, in winter's chill or summer's stifling heat, with an old hound dog at his bare feet, puffing on his homemade tobacco pipe and spinning tales the likes of which you couldn't find in any book. The village folks saw them as tall tales, a result of a lonely old man's idle mind, but those tales had a life to 'em, a rhythm and rhyme that was all Jeremiah's own.

Paradoxically, in our quest for evolution and progress, we've wandered into a maze of racial divides and social inequality, a stark contradiction to the collective heartbeat of humanity. The seed of dissolution has been sown, and whilst our lips speak love, our hearts pound in discordance, rending the fabric of unity and casting a shadow of vanquished hope. It is our solemn duty to dispel this encroaching darkness, for the essence of our existence should encompass unity rather than division, love rather than hate, hope rather than despair.

Yet, suffice it to say, we plow on, till field or fall, stirred by some unquenchable spirit, longing for the uncertain bounty that life offers. It's quite a curiosity, this existence, a laughing brook meandering through the vale of time, carrying us unwillingly in its tuneful glee, reminding us to smile, even as we tumble down its ceaseless path.

His shirt, once white as a churchman's collar, had taken on a faded, grass-stained patina, and his dungaree trousers showed more patches than original fabric.

Yet, the populace held respect for his discerning intellect and his unobtrusive attempts at charity. This magnanimity gave his family the lustrous patina of noblesse oblige, deftly overshadowing the more frivolous pursuits of his children, as families of consequence in Meryton were wont to do.

288,92938,1,"Upon a tempest-tossed London night, where chimney smoke did invariably tangle itself with fog to dance a macabre waltz above the shivering city, there persisted a narrow alley. This humble passage, only wide enough for a miser's generosity, was lined by dwellings that cowered and leaned together as though exchanging tales of sorrow and survival. Their haggard windows, like the eyes of shipwrecked sailors, looked out onto the world in weary bewilderment, while their stones whispered their age-worn secrets to any wayfarer brave enough to listen. Here, an ebb and flow of humanity coursed through its gloomy depths - beggars with fortuneâ€™s harsh heel upon them, scholars denied their dues, and children whose laughter had been traded for labor's cruel yoke - each weaving their own strand into the well-trodden, woeful tapestry of the forgotten alleyway.

The ladies of the town prided themselves on their apple pies, and the men, their hounds. The place had a sort of charm about it, the kind that made even the lordliest of city slickers feel a tickle in their chest. It was a place where the sun shone down with a golden warmth worthy of a king's envy, and the moon, a nightly guest, shone with a gentleness that could woo even the most troubled souls. Maybe it was the air, scented with the sweet fragrance of magnolias, or maybe it was the river, the ever-loyal friend forever trudging along, bearing tales from lands yonder.

292,95596,1,"Now, there ain't nothing quite like a Mississippi evening-they're peculiarly their own breeds of beast. The sun's always got a whimsical way of saying goodnight, with a stardust spray of oranges and pinks across the old canvas of the heavens. The waters below reflect and ripple with such bountiful blazes of color that you'd think it was their business to be the sky's mirror. Crickets orchestrate a lullaby for the day's end from the tall grass, their melodies scattered across the willow-lined banks. And let me tell you, friend, if there ever was a moment when Heaven's gate lay ajar and whispered its secrets, itâ€™s surely in the quietude of these sweltering, Southern twilight whispers.",synthetic,twain,Write an original paragraph in the style of Mark Twain.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,24.4,0.9931847453117372,0,0,0.7589285714285714,0.5625,2.491111111111111,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044642857,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.035714286,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0.017857143,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0.080357143,0,0.017857143,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.053571429,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0.017857143,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0.026785714,0.017857143,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0.008928571,0.008928571,0.008928571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1875,0.098214286,0,0,0.026785714,0.035714286,0.017857143,0.008928571,0.053571429,0,0.080357143,0,0,0.053571429,0,0,0.035714286,0.035714286,0.1517857142857142,0.1339285714285714

""Now, young Lyle, he werenâ€™t no ordinary lad. He was as quick with his mind as he was with his fingers, and he had this can-do spirit that was as refreshing as the first breeze on a sweltering August afternoon. Always tinkering, that boy was, always dreaming. Heâ€™d stare at the mighty Mississippi, its waters rolling along like a series of endless tales, while his thoughts stitched story upon story in the loom of his imagination. In Granny Hesterâ€™s knitted blanket of community, Lyle was our darndest firecracker dazzlin' the sky on Independence Day.""",synthetic,twain,Write a paragraph from an original novel in the style of Mark Twain.,gpt4,British/Irish,male,white,20.33333333333333,0.9925148487091064,0.076271186,0,0.711864407,0.6186440677966102,2.4983495145631065,0.008474576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025423729,0,0,0,0,0.008474576,0,0,0.016949153,0,0,0.016949153,0,0,0,0,0.008474576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.016949153,0,0,0,0,0.025423729,0,0,0,0,0.033898305,0.050847458,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.016949153,0,0,0,0,0.008474576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008474576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.033898305,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008474576,0.016949153,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008474576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042372881,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008474576,0,0,0.008474576,0,0.008474576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2796610169491525,0.042372881,0,0,0.008474576,0.084745763,0.025423729,0.016949153,0,0.008474576,0.093220339,0,0.008474576,0.050847458,0,0,0.033898305,0.059322034,0.1610169491525423,0.093220339
